<p>We who have been publishing The Bristol Edition are doing so with a simple goal in mind--to provide the people of Bristol with an online community newspaper that gives them facts, information, entertainment, and at times, opinions, about this city we live in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are pleased with our progress at this time. Our readership continues to expand and we have been able to cover many interesting and informative stories about our city. But we want to be able to do even more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this time, our staff is small (currently five contributors) and has been working hard without pay to accomplish our goals. Because of our size and the fact that four of our contributors hold full-time jobs, we have not been able to cover Bristol as completely as we would like. We need more staff to become the paper everyone in Bristol will want to read. Even so, we think we have already provided Bristol with a quality product.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe our coverage of sports is the best in town. Our sports reporter, Mike Letendre, has produced an amazing catalog of stories, not only about the games our local athletes play, but of the personal background stories that bring these athletes to life on the page.</p>

<p>Another of our writers, Rit Carter, specializes in longer, in-depth coverage of important events and people in Bristol’s past. He spends hours and hours doing research on these topics, and the articles he has published have been outstanding examples of long-form journalism.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another writer, Jack Krampitz, is a former Bristol teacher who has been able to find many smaller stories of interest to which he adds his own particular sense of humor. These include meeting announces, community events, city meetings... </p>

<p>Anna Bedell is a transplant from Australia who is in the process of getting a journalism degree from Harvard University. She has specialized in human interest stories and has recently covered Bristol’s Diversity Council.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our founding editor and the leader of this motley crew, Dave Fortier, is well-known around town as one of the founders of Bristol Today, a print publication that he and the late Dave Lepore, began in 1998 and ran until 2002. Dave is an experienced journalist who has been leading the rest of us on this Quixotic quest to give our town an online newspaper that is informative and reliable. He is currently state director for the Journalism Education Association and recipient of several Society of Professional Journalists awards.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, we incorporated as a non-profit with the State of Connecticut, under Central Connecticut Online Journalism Project Inc. Shortly, we will submit our application for 501 (c)(3) status from the U.S. government, which is donors to claim their contributions as charitable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon, we will be asking our readers to join us in our quest. As a community project, we are in this together. Together we make The Bristol Edition a viable online community newspaper -- and a viable business model. Which means we need financial support. As other non-profits like NPR or PBS do, we will be asking our readers to subscribe to TBE for a small monthly fee, $7 to $15 per month or whatever you can afford. This fee will be voluntary; you will still be able to read The Bristol Edition if you choose not to subscribe. But if enough people do sign up, we will be able to expand the depth and content of our paper together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We currently have close to 1,000 readers. If even 100 of those readers subscribe for $7 per month, we would have money to hire people to cover beats we don’t have the resources to cover now. City Hall meetings, big events in town, crime, fire, education--all of these areas need to be covered on a regularly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are looking forward to the day that we are the paper or record for the people of Bristol look to for their daily news. We are very aware that there is no source of that information in town now. What we need is for people to put a little “skin in the game,” and help us to be Bristol’s source for daily news and sports.</p>
