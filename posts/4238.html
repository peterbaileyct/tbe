<p>Since 2001, our friend over at Connecticut Wrestling Online, Gerry deSimas Jr., continues to keep fans of scholastic and collegiate wrestling in the know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And despite the pandemic and cancellation of the season for many programs around New England, news, rankings, and just general happenings are still shaping the wrestling landscape –even as gymnasiums and workout facilities for practices, meets, and tournaments remain closed and locked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one of the biggest treats on the Connecticut Online Website (ctwrestling.com) is the scholastic Record Book, updated for 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the pages of those historical records, the feats of several Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern grapplers are listed as both programs have been relevant since the 1960’s – churning out not just championship grapplers but programs that have taken home state titles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a fascinating read and the award-winning deSimas always puts together an insightful, polished look at wrestling around Connecticut on his website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of scholastic wrestling, a sport that was lost in this state due to the pandemic, Eastern’s own Ella Nichols continues to carry a national ranking as one of the top female grapplers in the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Wrestling Hall of Fame, USA Wrestling and FloWrestling on Friday, January 22 released the fourth national rankings for high school girls wrestlers for the 2020-21 season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This ranking evaluates all girls enrolled in grades 8-12, and athletes from all 50 states are eligible for selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entire weight class ranking can be viewed at nwhof.org and on that list, two grapplers from Connecticut – including Nichols – continue to draw national attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nichols is ranked sixth at 144 pounds in the latest poll which is the same position she found herself in last December.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Dakota Marie Dinelli, at 152 pounds, is the other ranked wrestler from the state, moving up two spots in the newest poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dinelli bumped up to No. 6 in the fourth poll as both ranked grapplers from Connecticut are in their junior season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the National Wrestling Hall of Fame website, there will be some upcoming tournaments that Nichols and Dinelli could take a part in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A number of national organizations are filling in their spring schedules. USA Wrestling has announced a new event, the High School National Recruiting Showcase late March, with eight qualifying events in early March, and competition in freestyle,” according to the website. “Current and past girls state champions at official and recognized unofficial state tournaments automatically qualify for the National Recruiting Showcase. The annual USA Wrestling Girls Folkstyle Nationals will also be held in late March.”</p>
