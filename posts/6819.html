<h1>Recuperating -- icing, exercising, napping -- not necessarily in that order</h1>

<p>Come Sunday morning, I will have had a new knee for just over a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a hard time comprehending this, but I will have been walking with a walker and later a cane, every day. My routine, I laughingly tell Mary, is that of an elite athlete. I spend all my time exercising—baby exercises but necessary ones if I am going to regain full mobility; icing—I have an ice machine, a cooler like thing with a tube and an attachment that I wrap around my knee; eating—to keep up my strength, but not eating too much and certainly eating foods that help the process; and sleeping, including napping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, there are the meds, which make&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this possible, and for which, I have been reminded, to stick to the recommended dosages to stay ahead of the pain. I have been&nbsp;fairly successful&nbsp;at this “staying ahead of the pain” but not totally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Silly me, I thought I might be able to get some of my own work done.  I have found that my ability to focus has been compromised, so that I have spurts of energy where I read a few pages or do some research, but that is about it. Most of the time, I have been replenishing the ice machine, wrapping my leg—I have added two large ice packs to the ice machine attachment so that I ice my entire leg—and exercises—walking on the second floor with the walker and doing the exercises. I have learned to do things the right way and to do them on schedule, but it takes effort and time. </p>

<p>The goal is to ice for 30-45 minutes and get up on my feet for 30 minutes and repeat for entire day. It’s a bit mind-numbing. I do my best to stick to the routine. Which, fortunately, I do more than not. It’s going to give me a jump on recovery, something I am counting on, since I would like to be in the classroom when school begins. At the same time, often, I find myself considering how someone. who is not as fortunate as I am, is able to&nbsp;manage.&nbsp;And I go off on a tangent about how crazy our health care system is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been able to catch up on a few podcasts—when I don’t nap through them. Reading is a more difficult task, but I have a few recommendations.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;I haven’t read the book,<em>&nbsp;</em>but plan to, but here is this week’s recommended listening/reading. Ann Murphy Paul talks about her book,&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;Extended Mind</em>, with&nbsp;Ezra Klein on this podcast. Click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-annie-murphy-paul.html?action=click&amp;module=audio-series-bar&amp;region=header&amp;pgtype=Article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have picked up several books after listening to Klein’s show. I mentioned one, Heather McGhee’s The Sum of Us last week. McGhee is a terrific writer, who blends research with storytelling and ends up making a compelling argument about racism—everyone is affected negatively by it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week I have been reading James Suzman’s Work. Suzman is a terrific writer in his own right. It is a book that I might have finished in a couple of&nbsp;days, but&nbsp;have had to limp through because my attention is a bit off, with the surgery and all. I am, more typically, a fiction guy. Having listened to Klein and then followed up his podcasts with the books, non-fiction mostly but not exclusively, I have been converted. Part of the equation, I am thinking, is that I enjoy good writing, which means sound thinking, and these writers are good writers, good thinkers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My point, however, is this. If you don’t have the time to pick up the books, at least familiarize yourself with the thinking, and the podcasts are a great way to do that. And you can listen again in the event you nod off!&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until next week!&nbsp;</p>

Among its features will be reviews of old and new books, sharing of favorite podcasts, some family news, Bristol events and happenings and issues surrounding education, work and community journalism.&nbsp;Fortier&nbsp;can be reached at&nbsp;dfortier@bristoledition.org.</em>&nbsp;</p>
