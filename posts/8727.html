<p>The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team is on a roll, just as the postseason is around the corner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Thursday, the Lancers made its only game against Plainville count – sinking the Blue Devils by a 1-0 final from Tinty Field in Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is now 5-6-1 with three matches left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scoring the game-winning goal for the Lancers was Megan Krok, assisted by Emily Nelson, with four minutes to go in the first frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That edge held into the half as neither squad scored in the second stanza, leading to the 1-0 win for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first half of play was very sloppy on both sides, looking like a ping pong game more than a soccer match according to Eastern coach Scott Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with around five minutes remaining in the first period, Eastern went on the attack in the scoreless affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers strung together a few passes with Taigan Parent settling a ball in the middle, playing Nelson in the center of the attack as Eastern was on the verge of scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nelson ended up playing&nbsp;a beautiful&nbsp;through ball to a streaking Krok who did the rest, beating the Plainville keeper for a goal – propelling the Lancers to a 1-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Halftime was an opportunity to reset and revive with the wind at the Lancers back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of play in the final half was controlled by the Lancers, creating numerous opportunities throughout the second forty minutes as Eastern outshot Plainville 17-2 overall in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Plainville's&nbsp;Amber St. Onge (three saves) and her back line was up to the task, covering all angles and watched many of Eastern shots sail wide of the target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, the Blue Devils didn’t have any answers for Grace D’Amato and the Lancers’ back line – earning another big shutout this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the end, Eastern was a 1-0 victor in Plainville as the Lancers moved one point away from CIAC state tournament qualification after earning two victories this week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss dropped the Blue Devils to 5-4-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We came in focused on getting two wins and four points this week,” said Redman. “We had to survive numerous injuries and players not at one-hundred percent and although it wasn't the best soccer and the way we wanted to play all week, we accomplished our goal and earned the four points."</p>

<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The Lancers have gone 3-1-1 over its last five matches to get one game within .500…Eastern has two more matches to play from Alumni Field this year, starting with a rematch against Berlin next Tuesday at 6 p.m. under the lights…Earlier in the season, the Lancers – leading at the half – let one slip away at Berlin as Eastern dropped a tough 4-3 decision back on September 13…Berlin is also on a two-match winning streak, sinking Platt 8-0 and then dropped Central by a 2-0 push this past Thursday. The Redcoats are currently 6-4-3 overall.</p>
