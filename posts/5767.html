<p>BRISTOL – With the Bristol Eastern and North Haven softball squads embattled in a 3-3 stalemate going into the bottom of the final inning of its CIAC Class L, first round showdown, which standout from the Kingstreeters was going to tally the game-winning hit?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After setting up the table in the seventh, Eastern’s Jasmine Perez was once again at the plate with ducks on the pond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would she generate the game-winning hit? Would it be time for Perez to shine once again for the Eastern softball program?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a resounding yes to both questions as Perez took the first pitch she saw over the fence in right-center field as the walk- off, three-run home run propelled No. 15 Bristol Eastern to a 6-3 win over No. 18 North Haven on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, now a sterling 14-6, earned a shot at No. 2 St. Joseph on Wednesday in second round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Cadets went undefeated (16-0) in regular season play, earned a first-round bye, and currently at 19-1, St. Joseph is ranked fourth in the most recent The GameTimeCT Top 10 Softball Poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But yesterday, Eastern had contributions from all over the field and at the plate to topple North Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perez was sensational, going 3-of-4 with four RBI along with the home run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitcher Ali Tellier was also 3-for-4, Jazmyn Browne went 2-for-3 with an RBI while Grace D’Amato and Alex Shorette were both 1-of-3 as the Lancers tallied 10 total hits for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Eastern kept the mistakes to a minimum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jazmyn and Jasmine locked it down defensively behind Ali,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors threatened in the top of the first inning, putting two on with just one out but Tellier induced a fielder's choice ground to Perez at third and the other ball found its way to Browne to end the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier singled in the first but was unable to come around while in the second stanza, the Lancers went for two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato blasted out a leadoff double, went to third when Shorette tallied a base hit and tagged the dish on a passed ball to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Browne kicked in an RBI single to score Shorette as the home team led 2-0 after two completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier did a fantastic job keeping North Haven batters at bay and through four-and-a-half innings, it was still a 2-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fifth, Eastern scored once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier dropped in a base hit, went to second on a Riley Giblin sacrifice bunt, and scored on a single by Perez as the Lancers nabbed a 3-0 push going into the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in the top of the sixth, North Haven was on the move.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two bloop singles put the tying run at the plate with no outs as the Indians were a hit away from making it a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caroline Toni then scorched a two-RBI double down left-center,&nbsp;chopping the deficit to 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An RBI single to right tied the event at&nbsp;3-3 but the Eastern defense took over from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An overthrow at the plate led to a North Haven runner attempting to score from second but Eastern catcher Janessa Gonzalez chased the ball down and flipped to Tellier covering home plate for the out as the go-ahead runner was cut down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier got out of the spot by inducing a fly ball to right and then added a big strikeout as the game was still a 3-3 affair heading into the seventh.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An error gave the Indians another go-ahead runner in the top of the seventh but a line out to Browne at shortstop helped force a double play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the catch, Browne fired a dart to first – doubling off the runner to end the inning – as Eastern was looking for late game heroics to nab the victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone in the bottom of the seventh, Tellier got on base for the third time with another single.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giblin then drew a walk and pushed the winning run to second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it didn’t matter as Perez ended the contest with her three-run home run blast as Eastern survived and advanced by a 6-3 final.&nbsp;</p>
