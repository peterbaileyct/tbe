<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Merchants, the 2009 Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League champs, were looking for another postseason title appearance in 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad defeated People’s Bank </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>by an 8-4 final in a winner-takes-all championship showdown the previous season. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That victory gave the Merchants both the 2009 regular season and playoff titles and the locals were looking for a repeat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants were 190-78 going into the 2010 campaign, hoping for another long postseason run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the pitching front, Ryan Pacyna and Kevin Rival did most of the hurling while Eric Butkiewicz and Jarrett Stawarz started a combined 10 games in 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brian Archibald also tossed a couple contests, Matt Arburr started two games while Rick Hewey also made a start for the Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nick Macellaro, Justin Fuller, and even Bristol coach Bunty Ray all took the hill at times for the Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the plate, Joe Parlante didn’t miss a game while Ray, Rick Barrett, and Macellaro all played in at least 21 of the 25 regular season games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Matt Hackney, Stephen Clout, Joe Vecca and Arburr added a little pop to the Bristol line-up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got a lot of guys out” for the team said Ray to Michael Letendre of the Bristol Observer. “I’m carrying the biggest roster I’ve ever carried. There’s a lot of commitments out there [and] some injuries. It’s nice to see the younger kids coming up, kids that will hopefully play when [the current group of veterans] are long gone. These are kids who played in college, played in [American] Legion, and there are not enough kids who want to continue to play. Hopefully, these kids continue to play through their adulthood, adults playing [GHTBL] just like we did.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s important."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players that saw action in at least five games included Jay Maule, Chris Klepps, Tony Geraci, Clout, Paul Franceschi, and veteran Adam Peters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler McIntyre (four games, .333 average), Ryan Dudzinski, and Aaron Granahan all saw action for the Merchants over the 2010 regular season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After splitting its opener on May 25, the Merchants defeated the East Hartford Jets on the road by an 11-6 final on June 14.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arburr&nbsp;exploded for two home runs in the game while Bristol used an eight-run sixth frame to turn a close contest into a bit of a runaway.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then after dropping a doubleheader to the Meriden Merchants on June 16, Bristol was under .500 (2-3) but was about to embark on an amazing 23-game winning streak.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the completion of June, Bristol improved to 9-3 and was looking for more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[When we were] 2-3, it didn’t sit very well” with us said Ray. “It seems like every year, that’s the way we start. A lot of teams are kind of questioning if we still have it or not. To be honest also, I picked up some younger players that have been chipping in and they filled in the roster nicely during games and it’s nice to see the Bristol kids coming through.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants went undefeated in July, starting with a huge 2-1 victory over People’s Bank on the eighth of the month.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pacyna chucked a four-hitter while Franceschi singled home the winning run in the fourth frame to help the Merchants keep its winning streak alive, moving to eight straight victories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win kept the squad from Bristol within 1.5 games of GHTBL leaders Meriden (12-2) and People’s Bank (14-4).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then after nine days off, Ray roped up his 200th career win as coach of the Bristol Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parlante and Arburr belted home runs as the Merchants nabbed a 4-0 victory over RMR Construction.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol dropped the New Britain Stingers over identical 3-1 scores in a doubleheader on July 19 to move to 14-3 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that 2-3 start was just a distant memory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think way back to the point [we were 2-3] and I said I’m not worried and you can see why,” said Ray. “We’ve been doing this for a long time, and I knew once we caught a rhythm and once we were able to get some guys healthy and tweak our roster a little bit, that we would be fine. That’s what happened here.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 25, Ray smashed an RBI double in the first game for the Merchants in a 5-4 comeback win over the Vernon Orioles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the immediate rematch, Bristol shutout the Orioles by a 6-0 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was thanks in part to an outstanding effort on the hill by&nbsp;Butkiewicz as he allowed just five hits as Vernon did not post a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winning didn’t stop in regular season play and on July 31, Bristol earned its&nbsp;20th consecutive win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants took the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League 2010 regular season championship as the squad sank Avon, 6-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going into postseason play, the locals were looking to seize its fifth playoff championship since 2004.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol trailed People’s Bank (21-6) by two games towards the end of the season but thanks to that 20-game winning streak, the Merchants were able to flip out the regular season championship – earning the No. 1 seed in postseason play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tournament, that takes place yearly from McKenna Field in East Hartford, saw Bristol start play against RMR.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol defeated RMR by a 9-4 final on August 7 and then spun Vernon by a 6-1 push the following day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On August 9, the Merchants won its 23rd straight game, spinning Meriden by a 7-1 final – moving to 25-3 on the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the playoffs, you’re now just seeing veteran hitters take pitches, getting to good hitter’s counts and you’re seeing guys producing in run-scoring situations,” said Ray.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Macellaro kept the offense going with his hot bat – going 3-for-4 with three RBI – over a big-time performance against Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An RBI base hit from Macellaro in the third inning broke up a well-pitched game by Meriden’s Eric Polvani (5 IP, seven hits, three ER, five walks) as Maule and Ray – sneaking home on a passed ball – made it a 2-1 contest in Bristol’s favor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rival, allowing just one run on a Joey Serfass RBI single in the top of the third tilt, got into the groove from the fourth inning on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed no runs and just three hits the rest of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s not really a starter,” said Ray of Rival. ”He’s a guy that you can give the ball to, comes in, and a lot of the times, he’s out there pacing himself, he’s throwing pitches [and] coming in [to] shut the door. But no matter what he does, it seems like he can get it done. He’s exceptional.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rival added a little offensive of his own in the fourth frame as he drilled a 340-foot shot over the fence to make it a 3-1 contest through four.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Klepps scored on a wild pitch in the sixth inning and a two-RBI double to the gap in right field by Macellaro propelled the Merchants’ to a 6-1 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that would be the final win for Bristol in the postseason, ever.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden forced a winner-take-all championship tilt with its 6-1 win over Bristol on August 10 and then shutout out the Merchants the following day by a 2-0 final to win the postseason title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the last game for Ray as a manager – or player – in the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League with the Merchants finishing up at 25-5 overall in 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I can’t ask for anything” more said Ray. “This is the seventh straight year we’ve been in the playoff championship.”&nbsp;</p>
