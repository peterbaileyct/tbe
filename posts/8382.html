<p>BRISTOL - Are we ready for a little city series volleyball on Monday night?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s about time Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern clashed once again as the squads are ready to go to war for the first time in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are looking for a little payback as the squad had an amazing season during the pandemic shortened campaign last year - going 11-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And who did Central lose to in 2020?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Eastern - getting to the pay window twice against the Rams - as the squad was undefeated last fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that final match between the squads on October 29 was a 3-2 game from Central that either program could have won.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this is a new year, a new day, and Central is looking to break what has turned into a ridiculous streak that is nearly unbelievable to comprehend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone knows about the streak but this time around, it’s two teams with identical ledgers ready to square off one more time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re anywhere in the Bristol Central area, don’t miss this match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be worth the price of admission as Central/Eastern put another page of their storied history into the record books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick preview of what to expect on Monday:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>City Series Volleyball:</strong> Bristol Eastern (8-2) at Bristol Central (8-2)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location: </strong>Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium from the campus of Bristol Eastern</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s on the line: </strong>Pride, a ninth victory, and a 53-match winning streak by the Lancers that the program would love to extend with a win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Question: </strong>Will the Rams finally beat its crosstown rival for the first time since 1994 or will the Lancers make it victory No. 54 in a row?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s look at both teams…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN (8-2)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach: </strong>Stefanie Reay</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who have the Lancers lost to this year? </strong>The Class L squad lost to South Windsor (3-1 on September 9) and at home against Glastonbury (3-2, October 1) that went deep into a fifth set and then some.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is the Lancers’ winning streak: </strong>Currently none. The five set loss to Glastonbury last Friday was the last match the program played in. Before that setback, Eastern won eight straight matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Interesting Eastern Fact: </strong>The Lancers are solid on the road this season, going 3-1 with just the loss at South Windsor to open the campaign. Eastern brings a three-match road winning streak into Bristol Central on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who to watch from Eastern (statistics via MaxPreps): </strong>Hannah Webber (sr, 174 kills, 24 aces, 10 blocks, 35 digs); Lauren Bender (jr, 99 kills, 28 aces, 58 digs); Emily Valentine (fr, 42 assists); Lilli Lowe (jr, 29 kills); Alyssa Adorno (jr, 30 aces, 63 digs); Alex Shorette (sr, 48 kills, 41 aces, 73 digs); Sarah Lacouture (jr,); Gabby Caucci (so,); Abby Jones (sr, 20 aces, 44 digs, 265 assists).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL (8-2)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach: </strong>Lance Pepper</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who have the Rams lost to this year? </strong>The Class LL program dropped matches at RHAM (3-1 back on September 9) and Platt (3-0, September 22).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is the Rams’ winning streak? </strong>Currently, Central is on a four match winning streak including victories over East Catholic (3-2), at Maloney (3-2), Platt (3-0) and at Farmington (3-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Interesting Central Fact: </strong>The Rams have not lost at home this year, going a clean 5-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who to watch from Central (statistics via MaxPreps): </strong>Madison Lodovico (jr, 107 kills, 20 aces, 68 digs); Brooke Valentino (jr, 63 kills, 45 digs); Sarah Romano (sr, 19 aces); Olivia Clingan (jr, 31 aces, 26 blocks); Alex Rivera (so, 40 aces, 53 digs, 235 assists); Abby Pirog (sr, 33 kills, 19 blocks); Olivia Fiorito (sr, 47 digs); Samantha Sklenka (jr, 187 digs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Any opposing matches stand out between the squads? </strong>Bristol Eastern went to Platt on September 27 and swept the squad, 3-0. On the flip side, Central fell to the Panthers in Meriden 3-0 (September 22). Take it for what it is in terms of like opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final Thoughts…</strong>Get to the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium for this amazing showdown. You won’t leave disappointed, you’ll probably going to be there for two hours of exciting volleyball action and no matter who wins, either this ridiculous streak that was started in the mid-1990s will continue or a new one will form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be a great match no matter what the ultimate outcome ends up being as some of the best scholastic athletes in town take the court.</p>
