<p>TRUMBULL - The Bristol Eastern softball squad ran into one of the top programs in Class L second round tournament play on Wednesday - falling to No. 2 St. Joseph by a 7-0 final from Trumbull.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eighteenth ranked Lancers ended their campaign at 14-7 overall while the second-seeded Cadets improved to 20-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Joseph hosts No. 10 Naugatuck (17-3) in quarterfinal round play on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern generated just one hit as Ali Tellier led off the top of the first inning with a base hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was sacrificed to second off a bunt by Riley Giblin but never advanced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Joseph pitcher Lauren Wasikowski did not allow another hit in the game, and struck out seven of the next eight batters she faced off the Giblin sacrifice, in wrangling up the victory for her team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She fanned 13 batters overall while allowing just one base-on-balls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier battled on the hill for Eastern, shutting out the Cadets over the first two innings of play while punching out five batters, and it was just a 3-0 game through five innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the sixth stanza, the Cadets went for four runs to put things out of reach for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home team ramped up four extra-base hits as Maddy Fitzgerald smacked a three-run homer in the sixth inning while Niamh Dougherty add a two-run round-tripper in the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wasikowski also blasted a home run while Jill Guilfoyle tallied a two-base hit as the Cadets advanced to the quarterfinal round of the Class L tourney with the shutout victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the final game for Bristol Eastern’s Jasmine Perez, Riley Giblin, and Jennifer Black – a trio of seniors who all did a commendable job in leading the team through an extremely stacked slate of CCC games and postseason play.&nbsp;</p>
