<p>MERIDEN - In the last road meet on its regular season docket, the Bristol Central boys track &amp; field squad flat out beat Maloney by a 128-18 score in a CCC South confrontation from Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams dominated on the track and then did extremely well in the field â€“ only failing to secure first place in the long jump event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise, it was all Central, now 4-1 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every relay race was won by the Rams as Austin Freve, Chris Roy, Ryan Sarmiento, and Ramon Peters took the win in the 4x800 event with a finish of 9:24.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x100 relay, Trey Jones, Jarrett Boxley, Xavier Browne, and Victor Rosa finished first in 46.65 seconds and in the 4x400 challenge, the grouping of Freve, Frankie Porrini, Peters, and Noah Conrod were winners in 3:49.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa was the victor in both the 100 (10.7 seconds) and 200 meters&nbsp;(22.28 seconds) while in the 110 hurdles, Boxley placed first with a finish of 16.81 seconds.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Per usual, Nate DeAngelo dominated the 1600-meter event (4:26) and in the quarter mile challenge, Noah Conrod took the win in 56.9 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Josh Poulin won the 300 hurdles in 53.68 seconds and Porrini was back at it in the 800 meters, nabbing a first-place time of 2:01.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end a nearly perfect day on the track, Chris Roy took the 3200 meters in 12:17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going to the field events, Jakob Salinas earned first place in the javelin with a toss 141 feet, four inches while Dan Lauretti was the winner in the discus (120 feet, five inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Malachi Jones took first in the shot put (43 feet, seven inches) while Treshawn Blair was a dual winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair made the winning leap in the high jump (Five feet, eight inches) and was the triple jump victor to boot (35 feet, 10 inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in the pole vault, Casey Quirion cleared seven feet for first place.</p>
