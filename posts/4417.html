<p>It took just one game this season for Bristol Eastern girls basketball standout Alyssa Kehler to establish herself as a major player in CCC Region B play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Kehler established a couple new career highs when the Lancers defeated Farmington by a 63-58 decision on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her 18 point and six rebound effort was her best in an Eastern uniform as she canned two huge 3s midway through the third stanza to quickly increase a double-figure cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was a great example of what Kehler is going to bring the Lancers offense this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, offense has always been her calling card but she also added two steals to her stat line against Farmington - showing a little defense as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She will help an Eastern front court along with fellow senior Sage Scarritt as the duo are expected to play a boatload of minutes this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is third straight season that Kehler has seen varsity action at Eastern and in the world of scholastic hoops, experience counts in large amounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kehler managed to play in all 24 games last season and when she competes against Central on Friday, it marks her 40th varsity contest at Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She broke into the starting line-up eight times in 2019-20, providing support at both shooting guard and small forward – carrying averages of 2.9 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 1.1 assists-per-game overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over those eight stating assignments, everyone started to get the picture of Kehler’s all-around abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those starts produced numbers of 5.9 points and 2.0 assists-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her best game of her junior campaign came against Career Magnet in New Haven on January 25.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If someone from Career had scouted Eastern, they would have been perplexed by Kehler as she burned the squad early and often.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was a crazy one as she scored her squad’s first 12 points and dropped a then career-high 14 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also nabbed four rebounds in that 50-32 non-conference victory. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kehler can pass the ball a little, going for a career-best five assists in the 52-45 victory at Hall on January 16 while grabbing two steals at Maloney in the previous game over a busy season of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She is just one of many players looking forward to the first city series game of the year against Bristol Central tonight.&nbsp;</p>
