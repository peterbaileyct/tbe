<p>“Our plan is to solicit donations to fund the restoration of the IAFF and Fallen Firefighters<br>monuments and to add a memorial to remember the tragic events of September 1, 2001,” said Sean<br>Lennon, President of Local 773.<br></p>

<p>“The project will be totally funded by Bristol Firefighters and contributions from the public and<br>businesses across the City," said Mayor Zoppo-Sassu. There will be numerous activities by the Fire Department over the months ahead to shine on a light on this project and to solicit donations.<br></p>
