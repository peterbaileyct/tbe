<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BERLIN – Bristol American Legion baseball coach Jerry LaPenta knew that Berlin’s winless start to the Zone 1 campaign was a complete fluke.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off recent great play, the Berlin squad became one of the hottest in Zone 1 as of late.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its showdown against Bristol on Tuesday from Sage Park in Berlin, Post 68 scooped up a 6-2 edge midway through the contest and was firmly in the driver's seat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there was the flip side to consider as Post 2 used a five run fifth to steal the lead as Bristol dropped Berlin by a 7-6 final – maintaining second place in the Zone 1 standings (10-4 Zone 1, 12-4 overall).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is 4-0 over its last four games and have won nine-of-ten Zone 1 tilts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Bristol fell behind 2-0, the squad popped two runs on the board in the bottom of the third (Bristol was the home team despite playing on the road) to tie things up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Post 68 fought back, notching four runs in the top of the fourth as Berlin wrangled up a 6-2 cushion to put the pressure back on Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And behind a seven-hit attack, culminating with a big five-run fifth, Post 2 made all the offensive plays late to take the game for good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We hadn’t played in eight days, so I was really nervous about the layoff,” said LaPenta. “It showed in the beginning. We didn’t have real competitive at-bats. Once we tied it up and Berlin put up four runs, we easily could just have gone away.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Lorenzetti started the game for Post 2 and did not allow a hit over his 3.1 innings of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He struck out nine and walked eight as the home team was only able to put two balls in play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Beaucar (3.2 IP, one hit) came into game in place of Lorenzetti during the fourth frame, allowing just one hit, and earned another victory out of the bullpen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ‘away’ team managed to score a run in the first inning as Garrett Fallon drew a one-out walk and scored off three passed balls.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti ended up fanning the side, leaving the score at 1-0, as Post 2 came up to bat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the first, Bristol’s Andrew Lozier drew a full-count walk but was stranded as Ryan Fradette lined out to end the first with Berlin ahead by a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti continued to throw heat into the second stanza as it was three up and three down – all via K – with Bristol looking to draw even in the bottom of the tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Kozikowski led off with a base-on-balls but never advanced while Justin Piskorski walked with one gone in the top of the third for Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He swiped second and third and with two outs, Post 2 was trying to hold the runner from scoring.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Hyde also walked to put men on the corners before a passed ball scored Piskorski to make it a 2-0 contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Brown generated the game’s first hit, a crafty bunt that Berlin pitcher John D’amore did a great job fielding but could not get the runner in time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Adam Caron slipped a single into left, runners were on first and second with one gone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A double steal got the duo into soaring position and when Fradette launched a ball into right field, the fielder gloved it but could not squeeze it in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two-base error allowed Brown and Caron to score and quickly, it was tied up at 2-2 through three.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the fourth, D’amore drew four balls with one out and an error at third put two men on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both runners advanced off a passed ball and when Camden Murphy walked, the bases were juiced for the top of the order.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another passed ball scored D’amore as Berlin reassumed the edge at 3-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Piskorski walked for the second time and with the bases loaded again, Beaucar came in to replace Lorenzetti.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[Catcher] Nate [Ouellette] was struggling. He hurt his thumb and was having a real hard time catching,” said LaPenta. “Mike was probably squeezing [the ball] a little bit. Sometimes that happens with Mike because he throws throw so hard. Matt came in and did an amazing job.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Berlin’s first hit belonged to Fallon as he blasted a two-RBI single to right-center as the visiting contingent led by three at 5-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To finish the scoring, Hyde dropped in a long fly-ball to center for the second out, but Piskorski scored from third base as Berlin secured a 6-2 edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that would be the end of Berlin’s scoring exploits as Beaucar shutdown the offense from there.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one retired in the fourth, Zack Rinkavage walked, and Ouellette dropped a ball into left for a hit to put two on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Nohilly advanced the duo but a groundout from Brown kept Berlin’s cushion at four through four.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quick 1-2-3 inning by Beaucar, Post 2 went on the attack to snare the lead for good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron was hit-by-pitch, Lozier sliced a single to short center and when Fradette was interfered with at the plate by Berlin’s Chris Gendron behind the plate, the bases were loaded without the benefit of an out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kozikowski then slipped a base hit by the shortstop to plate a run and when Bouchard dropped a single into left, another runner scored as Bristol chopped the deficit to 6-4. <br></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rinkavage took advantage of the relief pitcher Justin Piskorski, earning a bases-loaded walk, and when Ouellette hit a grounder in between first and second, the play was to second base.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the runner got to second safely in what turned into a fielder’s choice, Kozikowski scored on the play, and it was a brand-new game at 6-6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on an 0-1 count, Rinkavage went to steal home – just making safely under the tag in a bang-bang play – as Post 2 reassumed the lead at 7-6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What he was really supposed to do was steal home straight on the throw back from the catcher,” said LaPenta of Rinkavage. “That catcher [Gendron] is a pretty good catcher, and he was standing up with guys on base and firing it right back [to the pitcher]. The game got kind of crazy in that inning. [Gendron] was staying on his knees just kind of lobbing [the ball]. The plan was as soon as his arm goes back to throw [to steal home but] that time, he looked. He made a mistake. He should have run at Zack.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought [Rinkavage] was safe…it was a bang-bang [play and] and I thought it was a good call and the right call.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out in the top of the sixth and trailing by a run, Murphy walked and later took second but got himself in trouble as he was nearly picked off the bag.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But off a scrum, Murphy just beat the throw – making it safely into third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, he over-slid the bag, Bristol got the ball back and when Murphy tried to plow back into third base, Rinkavage tagged him out as the threat was squashed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the one-run lead in hand, Lorenzetti re-entered the game in the DH slot and smacked a single off the glove of the first baseman into right field as Bristol was at it again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the runner ended up stranded as the game went into its final inning with Berlin still trailing 7-6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a long delay as the Berlin coaching staff was protesting the Lorenzetti re-entry with the umpires, to no avail, Beaucar and the defense sealed the deal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a Fallon walk, two fly-outs and a strikeout ended the game as Bristol secured a much needed 7-6 victory in Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Like I’ve said all year, these guys have really shown me they’ve got some heart,” said LaPenta. “It was a big, nice win for us.”</p>
