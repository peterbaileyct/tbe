<p>The Bristol Central boys soccer team defeated Lewis Mills on Tuesday, 10/19, at Nassahegan Field in Burlington.&nbsp;<br><br>An early goal by Mark Palma off a direct free kick set the tone early for the visiting Rams. BC moved the ball well and created a few chances but were not able to add to their advantage.</p>

<p>Mills ended the half with some good ball movement, but once again the solid Rams defense limited their shots on goal and BC was not threatened. The first half ended with a one-goal advantage for Central.</p>

<p><br>From the opening whistle of the second half, BC was in total control of the game as they smothered the Spartans for the entire 40 minutes. <br></p>

<p>The Rams’ midfielders and forwards were relentless, and the pressure finally paid off on a goal by Carson Rivoira off a perfectly placed cross by Ethan Crumrine. </p>

<p> A few minutes later, an own goal by Central made it 3-1. However, any hopes by the home team of climbing back in the game were quickly erased as Frank Palma answered soon after to finish out the scoring and make it 4-1.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall it was a well played game by the Rams, and the second half was one of their best halves of the season.&nbsp; Not only did the Rams score 3 goals, but in the last 15 minutes, a shot that appeared to cross the line for a goal was not counted, and another BC shot hit the crossbar. <br></p>

<p>In addition, some Mills defenders made nice plays in clearing a few balls off of their goal line, and their netminder made several outstanding saves to keep the score in check.&nbsp;<br><br>Central’s next game is Monday at E.O. Smith at 3:45.</p>
