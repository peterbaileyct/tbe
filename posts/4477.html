<p>Now that the epic <em>rainstorm</em> has cleared out, how about some scholastic sports?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday features another local line-up of favorites with the Bristol Central boys and Bristol Eastern girls basketball teams at home for a little hoop action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both those squads are undefeated and have a very good chance at keeping those streaks intact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a preview of all the action on Wednesday from the scholastic front:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Southington (1-1) at Bristol Central (2-0)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium at Bristol Central</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights dropped a tough 55-48 overtime decision to start the campaign at New Britain while using a big first half last Friday to knockoff Plainville (49-37).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 13-2 third quarter burst helped Southington knock off the Blue Devils, but the visiting aggression will need four quarters of that kind of defense to have any chance against the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington senior Devan Bade is averaging 15.5 points-a-game to start the season and he’s a target Central should focus on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has this man in the middle averaging 36.0 points and 14.5 rebounds-per-game. Who on the Knights can stop this irresistible force?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can expect that center Donovan Clingan, Sean Wininger (10.5 ppg), and - hopefully - Damion Grasper (13.5 ppg) are healthy and ready to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 3-0 start is on the horizon for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (1-1) at Plainville (0-2)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Ivan Wood Gymnasium at Plainville</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils are winless on the campaign but&nbsp; remain a dangerous outfit none-the-less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lewis Mills just got by Plainville in their opener (47-46) and the Blue Devils dropped a tough 12-point loss to Southington after a lousy shooting second half last Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyshawn Johnson averages 12 points-per-game for Plainville but the squad has several contributors under newly minted head coach Scot Wenzel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alec Couture dropped in 22 in the loss at Mills while Brennan Staubley is one of the bright young athletes from Plainville who was heading for a 20-point game at Eastern last season before foul trouble eventually derailed him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have a good chance to score a victory in Plainville with senior guard Elijah Parent (18 points, 5.0 assists, 1.5 steals-per-game) in the mix as the long-range shooter always seems to elevate his game at the Ivan Wood Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trini Otero (12.0 ppg, 4.5 rpg) is looking to build upon his fast start to the season while Josh Kolano (9.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 3.0 steals-per-game) is ready for another breakout game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s always a tough one in Plainville but it should be a great showdown between the programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Girls Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central (0-2) at Southington (1-1)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Southington high school</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is looking to get to the pay window for the first time this season and Southington stands in the way of that reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights lost to Plainville at the buzzer last Friday (48-47) and are looking to bounce-back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kelley Marshall (14 points at Plainville) and Gabby Dangelo (10) were double-figure scorers against the Blue Devils and need to be closely monitored by the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Janessa Bartell is pumping in 11.5 ppg and is the leading scorer on the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso (7.5 ppg) is another player that can dump in double-figures on any given opponent while Brooke Watson is tossing in the same totals as Torreso.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ella Watson (8.0 ppg) is right there as well while Arianna Rivera (seven points versus Eastern) can also put the ball in the hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a game Central needs to win to get its season back on track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (2-0) vs. Plainville (2-0)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium at Bristol Eastern</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One team is going to draw its first loss of the year by the completion of this showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville has won its two games by a total of three points, foiling both Lewis Mills (35-33) and Southington (48-47).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team shows balance with the likes of Lilly Wazorko (11.0 ppg) leading the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kori Jones (8.5 ppg) can put the ball in the hoop as can Jaida Vasquez (16 points vs. Mills).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern is playing at home for the first time this year and is itching to get on the court from the famed ‘Lancer Dome.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Blue Devils might not have an answer for Eastern junior Ciara Collins who is posting simply staggering numbers (27.0 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 5.0 assists, and 2.0 blocks-per-game) this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’ll be joined by Sage Scarritt (10.0 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 2.0 spg), Alyssa Kehler (14.0 ppg, 6.5 rpg), Cali Doyon (9.0 ppg, 4.5 apg, 2.5 spg), and Taigan Parent (3.0 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 3.5 apg).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect big effort from the Lancers in Bristol as the Kingstreeters are ready to roll from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys Swimming/Diving</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central/Eastern/St. Paul Catholic at Platt/Maloney</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Platt high school, Meriden</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol outfit just dropped its opener by three points (94-91) and will have every chance to post a victory against the Meriden contingent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a good group of athletes, representing the best of boys swimming in Bristol, and Platt/Meriden should expect a battle to the end.</p>
