<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol American Legion Baseball team showed a bit of rust at the plate over its 6-3 win against Naugatuck on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has only played twice in the great month of July as Post 2 had nine days off between games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the start of July, Bradley International Airport nearly saw seven inches of rain - creating havoc in terms of schedule around the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even though Post 2 wrapped up 10 hits against Naugatuck, the most since the program tallied 11 against Simsbury on June 24, the swings were a bit off after the week-plus layoff from active competition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It did look like we haven’t hit in a week,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of the Naugatuck game. “I thought our swings were a little long and slow except for Ryan Fradette.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette was the one player who swung the bat like he hadn’t skipped a beat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Naugatuck, Fradette was slotted into the third position in the batting order, went a slick 3-of-4 and probably should have been perfect at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only a dropped ball in left, which could have gone for a sacrifice fly in the third inning, did not allow Fradette a 3-for-3 performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But his efforts supplied two RBI to go along with three singles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s really come up with some huge two-out, two-strike hits,” said LaPenta of Fradette. “He’s done a really good job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then off a tremendous effort by Mike Lorenzetti on the mound, which saw the big man zip up 12 Ks in 5.2 innings of action, Roberto Cruz could have closed out the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While a botched pickoff attempt took the save out of play, Cruz ended up winning the showdown as he nabbed four Ks over 2.1 innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz chucked only 35 pitches and will be eligible to pitch Monday against Newington if LaPenta so chooses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My plan was to pitch him Monday and I wanted to keep him under forty-five” pitches said LaPenta of Cruz. “But I said if he’s gone, I’m going to go for the win today and worry about” Newington on Monday.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Roberto did a great job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If everything goes to plan, Bristol is back in action Monday at Newington, Thursday for a huge showdown at West Hartford and against Berlin on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That week comes to pass, starting on Monday, if Mother Nature allows it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Who knows, with all the rain, it may get rained out on Monday,” said LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Race for Zone 1 heats up</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s win against Naugatuck on Saturday put Post 2 into a tie with Meriden for second place in Zone 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a huge win,” said LaPenta of the Naugatuck victory. “They’re a good club. They have a bunch of games coming up. They’re knock some people off.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden (6-2, .750) has a better winning percentage than Bristol (8-4, .667) for the second-best ledger in the zone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals have played 12 total Zone 1 games to date, three more than any other squad in the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford is 7-2 and in first place but has several games that must be made up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is just a half-game behind West Hartford for the Zone 1 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For us to stay where we are and not have five losses” is critical said LaPenta. “We have to take care of business tomorrow against Simsbury. And then we have a huge game against Newington on Monday. So there really aren’t any breaks.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 can simply keep winning games as the rest of Zone 1 picks each other off - one game at a time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Bristol isn’t going to take any opponent lightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That includes winless Berlin (0-9) who invades Muzzy Field on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m not looking forward to playing Berlin either,” said LaPenta. “They are 0-9 or whatever but when they have all their guys, they’re not a bad team.”</p>
