<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol American Junior Legion Baseball program dropped its last four games of the regular season - falling to 7-12 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 1-6 start, Post 2 played .500 ball the rest of the way and earned a spot in the 2021 CT State Junior Division Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Bristol pulled out a 7-8 ledger with four games left to play in regular season - nearly getting back to .500 before running thin on pitching during the past weekend’s games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday, Torrington defeated Post 2 twice, sinking the locals 15-5 and 9-1 from Riley Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game one, Ryan Maglio dropped the decision while Michael Roalf threw 70 pitches over 3.2 innings in game two for the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Sunday, Post 2 battled West Hartford and Simsbury over two tough games but Bristol could not generate a win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Post 2 was in it against West Hartford - trailing just 3-2 through three innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford then went on a 6-1 burst to secure a 9-3 edge - winning the contest by six runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cole Latko went 4.2 innings in the loss while in the second game, Post 2 hung around against Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was the ‘away’ team at the event and after one frame of play, Post 84 went in front, 6-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deficit surged to 8-1 and then 9-2 before Post 2 made it a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scored three times in both the fifth and sixth innings to trim the deficit to 11-8 through six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury threw a scoreless seventh to end the event as Bristol fell by three runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris dropped the decision for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How many Bristol pitchers are in the stew?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past weekend, Bristol coach Bill Mason used just about every pitcher he had on his roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four games in two days created a bit of havoc but Post 2 got through it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
