Neighborhood notes is a a regular feature. Notes correspondents send in tidbits about their neighborhood, little observations that occur that don't merit front page news but that make Bristol a community. For instance, a Neighborhood Notes submission might read something like this:

Part of the sign outside St. Joseph Church is missing. Monday on a walk around the block, I noticed part of the sign was no longer attached but was leaning against it. Wednesday, the piece was gone, leaving a empty space.

That's it. Of course, this leaves a few questions, the most important one is: What happened?

A Notes writer would then call St. Joseph Parish Center to find out what happened and follow up with a second report within the next few days.

Another Note might be something like this:

A hot item at the Bristol Farmers Market is pickles. During Wednesday's Farmers Market, held from 3 to 6 p.m. on the Federal Hill Green, I ventured over to the City of Bristol tent where Justin Malley, executive director of the Bristol Development Authority, told me that people can't get enough of the pickles.

He also told me that the vendor who sold the pickles couldn't make it but would be back the next week. Of course, the vendor, Two Pines Farm, was the one I was interested in. In fact, I had brought with me two empty jars to return.

The pickles: "Sour Dill Pickle Chips" and "Sour Dill Blazers."

Another type of Note might involve a report about neighbors who have returned from vacation--never a report when they are gone for obvious reasons.

The So-and-So's returned from India where they visited the Taj Mahal. They confirmed recent news reports about condition of the marble that covers the 16th-century marvel, saying the marble was pockmarked and dirty.

They also visited ... {You get the idea.)

<strong>Suggestions for Notes writers:</strong>

Notes are written in a conversational manner, sometimes using "I" but also based on observations. This is very important, Notes are devoid of opinion and commentary. In other words, they are fact-based reports. And, most certainly, they are not free advertisements. Reread the PIckle Note above and you will see that it may be flattering but it is not selling anything. Of course, someone reading this Note might want to try the pickles themselves or visit a farmers market. Sometimes Notes can be a few lines, other times a few or even many paragraphs. The goal is to use as few words as possible without devoid of interest. With experience, writers will figure this out.

Notes is a curated feature., which means I will review each Note and send comments and suggestions to Neighborhood Notes correspondents to educate them about how to make their Notes conform to TBE requirements. The goal is to produce a style and tone that is both informative and interesting without being overwrought.
