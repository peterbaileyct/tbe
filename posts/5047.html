<p>“The free program is sponsored from a grant through the United States Department of Agriculture and is being handled through&nbsp;Foodshare. The boxes include meat products, vegetables, and dairy products like yogurt, cheese and&nbsp;milk,”said&nbsp;Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “It’s been a great value added program during&nbsp;Covid, and also demonstrated to us, as policymakers, that more needs to be done on food insecurity across the City.”</p>

<p>“In the last 9 months over 22,000 boxes valued at over $660,000 have been brought into the community,&nbsp;said Donna Osuch, President of the United Way. “This program is available to anyone who could use a boost and will utilize the groceries. We also encourage people to split up and share the contents with other family members or neighbors.</p>
