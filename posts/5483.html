<p>BRISTOL - The softball squad from Bristol Eastern is not a pushover in the least this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But occasionally, a bad loss or two can occur along a busy schedule and that’s exactly what happened to the program on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin came to town to square off against the Lancers in a Central Connecticut Conference, South division confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats, one of the top teams in all the CCC, ended up blitzing the Kingstreeters by a 16-1 final from the Eastern softball field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game went only five innings as the mercy rule eventually ended play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the ninth straight win for the Redcoats, now 13-1, while Eastern fell to 8-4 off the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers did have a bright spot in the form of Jasmine Perez.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perez was able to take a ball yard, splashing out a solo home run in the third inning of play to get her team on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers never scored again as the program picked up a tough loss from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern won’t have much opportunity to dwell on the setback as the Lancers travel to Platt on Thursday, hoping to start a new winning streak in another CCC South tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is at 3:45 p.m. from the Platt high school diamond in Meriden.</p>
