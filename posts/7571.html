<p>Come Sunday morning, I will be anticipating a return to school. In Bristol, school starts a few days before Rocky Hill, where I have worked for the past 18 years. Time flies when you are having fun, and I have had fun there—and many adventures, including 10 years of returning to New Orleans, post-Katrina,&nbsp; with&nbsp;students and working with Habitat for Humanity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Ida bearing down on the Crescent City, I can only think of the people there, many of whom have become friends, and hope that the levee system can withstand the brunt of a hurricane, especially a category 4. One friend, Mike Serios of Mike Serios&nbsp;Poboys,&nbsp;each and every&nbsp;year invited us to his restaurant on Charles Ave. for dinner—no charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mike liked&nbsp;the idea that we were there to help and so he opened his doors to us. And it was all very simple, now that I think back. A couple of students who were helping organize the trip,&nbsp;simple&nbsp;put together a list of places in New Orleans, explained what we were doing and asked&nbsp;it&nbsp;there was anything they could do to help. Mike answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mike, a larger-than-life character provided us with meals and even complementary seating for a few Mardi Gras parades. The parade route passed right in front of his restaurant, where he puts up a special seating. A couple of our students even picked up some special items from several floats—no, not&nbsp;those&nbsp; Mardi&nbsp;Gras beads, which there were plenty of, but the special items that each float team creates and decorates and are valued by native New Orleanians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>His restaurant is also larger than life. Walk in the door and there is a seven ft. high tiger—Mike has not missed an LSU&nbsp;Tigers football game in years. He also has tucked away in his back room a pair of Shaquille O’Neal’s basketball shoes. Yes, he passed them around to students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am hoping for the best for NOLA and the people of the Gulf Coast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, there is Afghanistan, and that is something else altogether. There is so much going on, always, in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here in Bristol, we had a brush with our own hurricane turned tropical storm last weekend. We lucked out. I think at one point there were five residences without power. Some trees came down. On Monday, we learned that things might have been worse if the people at the Water and Sewer Department hadn’t decided to drain our reservoirs, reducing the flow of water through our own rivers and streams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So school is beginning, and I am planning to show up on Monday, my knee continuing to heal, looking forward to learning what being there a month and a half after a knee replacement means. And I will be driving myself. I have been practicing, starting with up and down the driveway, and then adding short trips around the block, and finally back and forth to physical therapy.&nbsp;</p>
