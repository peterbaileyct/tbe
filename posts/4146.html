<p>The overwhelming benefit of winning a scholastic state championship can be seen decades after achieving it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s been the case ever since the Bristol Central boys cross country squad took home the 2010 Class L title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long after the crew of Michael Duprey, Jacob Eschner, Connor Kelley, Ethan Washburn, Jake Mancini, and Spencer Johnson graduated from the program, the blueprint they helped establish – along with head coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk – still persists today.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And winning is a tradition several squads from Central has maintained to this day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams won CCC South titles in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 –&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;winning the division eight out of 10 times since the program seized the Class L championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even this year’s crew at 5-2 backed up last season’s outstanding team that tallied a 15-0 overall record (14-0 CCC South).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central could have been a three-time state champ as the recent squads from 2018 and 2019 were the runner’s-up in Class L, losing to a ‘school of choice’ that slipped into the tournament field both years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Xavier made up one of the many Class LL in 2017 and, for whatever reason, the all-boys Catholic school in Middletown was able to drop a class – even after winning the State Open and was the runner-up in LL during that 2017 campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just as Central was looking to add to its title collection, Xavier stood in the way – posting championship victories over the Rams in both 2018 and 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Flash-forward to my 2018 and 2019 teams and, let’s face it, if Xavier hadn’t been moved from Class LL to L, we would have been Class L Champions both of those years,” said Stafford-Kirk. “In 2018, Devin and Pacifico Flores, Mark Petrosky, Nate DeAngelo, and Jose Ramirez were, I believe, a stronger five than the 2010 [squad]. The 2018 team time was 1:24:52 and 2010 [ended up timing out at] 1:25:34. I do believe the 2010 [scoring] six was stronger than the 2018 six, however.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 2018 Class L race on October 26 from Wickham Park in Manchester,&nbsp;Xavier crushed all the competition, scoring 26 points compared to Central’s 80 which was outstanding on its own merits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One year later on October 26, 2019, Central held an early advantage in the Class L title bout but ended up falling to Xavier again, 62-94, in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That gap was greatly narrowed from 2018 to 2019 but Central came up just a bit short in the title round.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However,&nbsp;that 2010 unit helped to continue a winning culture and tradition that still exists today for the Bristol Central boys cross country team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between the CCC South and Class L banners in the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium, the effort, ability, and history of the program is carried on by its students athletes in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What I am most blown away by is the way the programs continues to grow and I owe it all to the past runners and teams,” said Stafford-Kirk. “They have built such a great legacy and current runners like Nate DeAngelo and Frankie Porrini and future runners want to continue and further that legacy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
