<p>The Bristol Edition continues to highlight Bristol Central’s Class L state championship cross country team from 2010, putting together the exploits of Mike Duprey, Jacob Eschner, Connor Kelley, Ethan Washburn, Jake Mancini, and Spencer Johnson’s run to the title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program’s talent was undeniable that year and head coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk felt that this special group was destined for some big things that season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We knew from day one of that season we could win the Class L title,” said Stafford-Kirk. “I can be very superstitious at times and could never bring myself to say outright that we could win it but we knew it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was Central challenged at all during regular season competition in 2010?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 16-0 overall and a perfect 14-0 in CCC South meets, that ledger painted a dominating picture but the team was pushed on more than one occasion – including Central’s first meet of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams opened the year against Conard in a CCC Interdivisional tilt from Bristol on Tuesday, September 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was the day Kelley established a new school record at Rockwell Park as he crossed the finish line in 17:15 – besting the old standard by better than seven seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duprey (17:56) and Eschner (18:07) came in third and fourth, respectively, as the Rams knocked off the Chieftains by a 25-30 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard was an excellent program that season as the squad won the boys CCC West title that year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bar was set extremely high and the Rams passed that first test with flying colors as the Chieftains were the perfect opponent to open with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Central’s meets in CCC South action weren’t that close, the Rams used several invitational events as a measuring stick to prepare for the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first challenge came on September 18 when Central faced steep competition at the Riverfront Festival – placing third overall from Riverside Park in Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brookline high school (MA) won the event with 44 points while Xavier of Middletown – the eventual Class LL runner-up – came in second place and was just a point off the winning mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central (67) did very well behind a fourth place finish from Kelley (16:07.3), 11th by Duprey (16:38) while Eschner (16:49.1) was one position behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hubbard Park in Meriden was Central’s next stop on September 21 when the Rams battled Bulkeley and Platt in a CCC South tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both squads fell to Central via duplicate 15-50 scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that meet, Kelley, Duprey, and Eschner all crossed the finish line in 17:43 – always a remarkable sight to see – while Washburn placed fourth in 18:18 and Johnson took fifth in 18:41 for the sweep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four days later, Central was intrenched in a cross country battle from the Stratton Brook Invite, nearly taking the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a sweltering 85 degrees that day on September 25 but the Rams pushed through, nabbing three of the top four spots in the race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Canton was just one point better as Central earned second place with a score of 75.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kelley (2nd place, 17:14), Duprey (third, 17:21), and Eschner (fourth, 17:33.9) all finished in the top-five as the Rams just missed out in winning the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Canton was another top-10 team in the state – winning the Class SS championship that year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on September 29, Central was back at its home base – Rockwell Park – hosting Berlin and Maloney in another CCC South confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Berlin/Maloney combination of CCC South teams didn’t fare any better than the rest as the Rams were 15-50 winners over Maloney while Berlin (15-47) nearly fell by the same score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kelley re-established his course record at Rockwell, winning the race in 17:09.7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams that day, Duprey (17:17.9), Eschner (18:09), Washburn (18:10.8) and Spencer (18:56.6) all helped Central win over the blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central moved to 5-0 overall, 4-0 in CCC South action as the Rams were undefeated going into the month of October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the next story in the TBE, the month of October will be broken down as the Bristol Central cross country team prepared for its biggest month ever in program history.</p>
