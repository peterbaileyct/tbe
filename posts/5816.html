<p>NEW BRITAIN - At the boys Class L Track and Field Championships from Willow Brook Park in New Britain on Monday, June 1, the program from Bristol Central had several tremendous finishes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Rams placed fifth as a team with 51.5 points and wasn’t far off the final first and second place totals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hillhouse won the title behind 61 points while Conard and Naugatuck - who both scored 54 points - tied for second place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor ended up in fourth place and was just a point behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if Central was at full strength that day, the Rams could have finished a little bit higher in the final standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[The] Bristol Central boys had a great meet today” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “Even with the loss of one of our integral relay members to quarantining and a couple injuries that kept athletes from competing, we placed fifth and were only 2.5 points out of second place. I’m really proud of the boys for stepping up in a tough year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central made top-eight performances up and down the line-up which included personal bests, school record breaking performances and even an All-State nod.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Nate DeAngelo broke the school records in both the 1600 and 3200 meter events in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the mile challenge, DeAngelo placed second with a time of 4:15.91 and then in the two-mile extravaganza, he took fifth at the Class L event in 9:12.98.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the javelin, Jakob Salinas’s throw of 163 feet saw the senior take fifth place - punching his ticket to the State Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Captains Nate DeAngelo and Jakob Salinas have led the team through a lot of ups and downs this season,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Both will be competing in the State Open next week. DeAngelo has shattered the 1600 and 3200 meter records this season [and] Salinas continues to be one of the top javelin throwers in the area.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the short distance sprints, Victor Rosa was tremendous in both the 100 and 200 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 200 meters, Rosa won the race in 22.63 seconds and earned All-State in the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was also pretty good in the 100 as well, finishing as the runner up in 11.23 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Junior Victor Rosa really stepped it up for us this year in the sprints,” said Stafford-Kirk. “What he has done as a first year sprinter is nothing short of amazing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Frankie Porrini was absolutely tremendous in three different events at the Class L championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the high jump, Porrini nabbed fourth place with a leap of five feet and eight inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 800 meter event saw Porrini finish in 2:02.48, good for sixth place, and he saw success in the 1600 meters - also placing sixth in a time of 4:24.62.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sophomore Frankie Porrini continues to run blazing fast times in the 1600 and 800 and comes up big for us in the high jump - a very difficult combination,” said Stafford Kirk.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treshawn Blair made gains in both the high and triple jumps at the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair took seventh in the high jump at five feet, eight inches and then in the triple jump, his best leap of 42 feet, one inch was good for sixth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the field, Malachi Jones took eighth place in the shot put (42-11.5) and Dan Lauretti surged to eighth in the discus (128-2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Also a sophomore, Treshawn Blair is a first year track athlete who scored for us in triple and high jump,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Juniors Dan Lauretti, Malachi Jones, and Eric Facey have been outstanding and will be a great asset to the team as seniors next year.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in the 4x100 relay, the combination of Cassias Breland, Xavier Browne, Tre Jones, and Rosa took eighth place in 44.47 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was an excellent showing in a very loaded relay field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I can’t forget about our 4x100 relay,” said Stafford-Kirk. “We had to shuffle them around a lot this year due to injuries but they came up big with an eighth place finish today!”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all those excellent finishes, Central will send several athletes to the State Open challenge as the postseason continues for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[The] top five qualifiers go to the Open,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Rosa (100,200), DeAngelo (1600, 3200), Salinas (javelin), and Porrini (high jump) are in for sure.”</p>
