<p>BRISTOL - The boys at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern have put together a powerful lacrosse co-op and on Monday, that crew had its collective sights on Wolcott in a non-conference affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Bristol combo was able to wallop Wolcott by a 12-4 final from the Bristol Central turf field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a resounding victory by the locals as several standouts helped the get the squad to the pay window in the programs first regular season match of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense was the key as the defensive front, featuring Jack Stavens, Samuel Anderle, Somaneen Kheau, and midfielder D’Andre Wiggins, helped limit the Eagles (1-2) to just the four goals on 16 shots.</p>

<p>Credit to Max Stavens in the goal, nabbing 12 saves along the way to limit the damage by Wolcott.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayden Cross also played extremely well according to Bristol Eastern assistant coach Logan Geller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The fierce wing attackmen, Ayden Cross, broke down the defense with sound vision and devastating shots to tally two goals and two assists,” said Geller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>X-man Andrew Spina dominated down the stretch, leading the Bristol co-op on a big 6-1 scoring run in the second half that helped put the contest away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spina ended up with four goals and two assists.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But offensive contributors came on all sides of the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It is hard to talk about Bristol lacrosse without mentioning Jeffrey Tallon,” said Geller. “Alongside midfielders Aidan Kowalcyk, Nathan Shorette, and Alexander Brand, Jeffrey was able to run through the opposing midfield with ease.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jeffrey also secured possession for Bristol, winning over 55-percent of faceoffs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tallon netted three goals while tallying up an assist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol midfielders Austin Selzillo and Dylan Brown also joined in on the offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kowalcyk added a solo effort goal while Brown led the team in caused turnovers alongside Somaneen Kheau.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Mason Coco was able to steer the offense down the final stretch, assisting on two shots as the Bristol squad was a big winner at home.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Geller and the rest of the coaching staff for the co-op expect some big things for the program in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Unambiguously, the Bristol boys lacrosse team has a bright future ahead of them,” said Geller. “Talented playmakers lining both sides of the field should facilitate an exciting season.”</p>
