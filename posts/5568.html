<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls tennis team ended up sweeping singles action against Plainville on Monday, May 17 before the rain came, and while the final two double bouts were never completed, it didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were able to scoop up a 4-1 victory over the Blue Devils in CCC South play from the Bristol Eastern tennis courts.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 4-9 overall, dominating singles play but the second and third doubles matches were canceled due to the thunderstorms and rain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville (2-12) was in the mix over singles play but Eastern proved to be the better side in the end.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In top singles match of the day, Eastern’s Brooke Treannie defeated Kimmy Xiques by scores of 6-3 and 7-5.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then at No. 2 singles, Brianna Kelley had very little trouble against Peyton Stehle - seizing set score wins of 6-1 and 6-0.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ava Gesner, Eastern’s No. 3 singles competitor, turned away the Blue Devils’ Christine Dai (6-0, 6-1) and in the final match, Trisha Mohan (No. 4) defeated Plainville’s Sam Shumbo by identical 6-2 set scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
