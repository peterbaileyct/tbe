<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(BRISTOL, CT June 18, 2020) – Sustainable CT, a statewide initiative that inspires and supports communities in becoming more efficient, resilient, and inclusive, announced its 2020 spring certified communities recently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The City of Bristol is one of only two Connecticut municipalities to be recognized for achieving Sustainable CT certification for the spring of 2020. The City met high standards in a broad range of sustainability accomplishments to qualify for the prestigious bronze-level certification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its application for Sustainable CT certification, the City of Bristol demonstrated significant achievements in actions in nine sustainable impact areas ranging from inclusive community building, thriving local economies, and vibrant arts and culture to clean transportation and diverse housing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bristol will be recognized later this year at the Annual Convention of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities along with all spring and fall 2020 certified communities.</p>

<p>“The Sustainable CT initiative also allows our Facilities &amp; Energy Manager, David Oakes, to work across department lines to identify savings and opportunities to work more efficiently,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “As an example, the Board of Education and City Hall building maintenance functions were integrated to allow us to be more flexible and leverage resources.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sustainable CT has seen strong momentum and growth as a valuable, high-impact program.&nbsp; One-hundred six municipalities have registered for the program, representing 79% of the state’s population. Collectively, forty-eight municipalities, over 28% of the state’s communities, have earned Sustainable CT certification since 2018. Certification lasts for 3 years, with submissions rigorously evaluated by independent experts and other Sustainable CT partners. The highest level of certification currently offered is silver.</p>

<p>“Everyone across all departments is to be commended for this achievement. We’re not done yet – we’ll be filing an application later this summer to hopefully reach the highest level offered, silver-level certification, for the fall of 2020,” stated David Oakes, Public Works Facilities &amp; Energy Manager for the City of Bristol.</p>

<p>“Congratulations to Bristol and New Britain, our newest Sustainable CT certified communities,” said Lynn Stoddard, Executive Director of the program. “They join a growing number of certified towns and cities, representing 44% of the state’s population that are demonstrating municipal practices that make our communities more inclusive, healthy, connected, and strong.”</p>
