<p>TBE's investigation the history of the Bristol Merchants of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League continues this week – focusing on the franchises’ second season in 2002.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program picked up 23 wins that year which was a huge improvement from the previous campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, Bristol was in first place after 10 contests and carried a 16-4 record through twenty games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants finished the season in fourth place by the end of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 10, it was the Merchants’ first victory of the coach Bunty Ray era as Chris Strahowski threw a two-hitter and struck out 10 as Bristol spun KGA by a 4-1 final from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Peters and Nate Gawitt had two RBI apiece for the Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in a doubleheader against Berlin on June 12, the Merchants wrapped up wins of 6-4 and 6-3 to move to 3-1 on the campaign. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCann and Mullins each had two hits and collected a grand total of five RBI. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The McCann/Mullins duo also threw a nine-hitter from the mound as Bristol was a half-game over the Newman Lincoln Mercury franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on July 16, Archibald pitched five innings (two hits, four K’s) against KGA as Bristol was a 4-0 winner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Season Notes&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right up to the end of the regular season, Bristol had a chance to win the league.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants went from seven wins in 2001 to 23 victories the following season – the biggest turnaround in the GHTBL that year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Kulak (.359), Ryan Smith (.367), Mullins (.375 with a team-leading 23 RBI), Mike Church (.348) and Matt Hackney (.324) were all efficient from the plate.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Second Team honors went to Ray for his play at second base and Archibald for his excellent pitching performances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players for the Merchants that season included Ray, Adam Peters, Brian Archibald, Chad McCann, Chris Strahowski, Nate Gawitt, Corey Parker, Ryan Smith, Mike Kulak, Ryan Madore, Nate Milbrandt, Matt Hackney, Nick Mullins, Eric Carlson, Eric Baim, Jerry Hasler, Adam Platt, Ed Dickman, Eric Bayne, Kevin Browning, Mike Church, Jarrett Stawarz, and Kevin Kosikowski.&nbsp;</p>
