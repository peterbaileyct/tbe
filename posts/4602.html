<p>The City of Bristol has again received the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) for its Fiscal Year 2020-21 budget document.</p>

<p>“Bristol’s continuing achievement of this award reflects the commitment of the Board of Finance, City Council, and talented staff in providing a document that meets the highest standards in governmental budgeting,” said Board of Finance Chairman John E. Smith.</p>

<p>“To receive this award GFOA has established nationally recognized criteria and guidelines that the document must meet,” said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu.  “These criteria include that the budget serves as a policy document, a financial plan, an operations guide, and a communications device. The city rated very well in all categories.  Constructive comments for improvements will be incorporated in the FY2021-2022 budget document.”</p>

<p>Comptroller Diane Waldron noted that this is the 21st year that the city has received this award, and&nbsp;commended her staff for their work putting the document together. “The budget award would not be possible without the attention to detail the Comptroller’s staff put into the entire budget process every year.&nbsp; We are always looking for ways to improve the document so it is easily understandable to the taxpayer while providing useful information on the city’s finances and departmental budgets&nbsp;while at the same time meeting the&nbsp;rigorous GFOA criteria,” said Waldron.</p>
