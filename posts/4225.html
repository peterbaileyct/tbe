<p>On January 26, 1999, the Bristol Eastern boys basketball squad battled Newington in a CCC South confrontation from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in that contest played twenty-two years ago today, a future Green Beret from Eastern drained a game-winning buzzer beater to stave off the Indians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the game tied at 46, Eastern senior John Phelan dribbled around traffic and unleashed a half-court bomb as time expired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And his shot fell cleanly through the hoop as Eastern came away with a thrilling 49-46 victory for the program’s fifth win of the campaign (5-6 overall).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Phelan, a Special Forces veteran who has battled ISIS in Afghanistan, had a different kind of engagement on his hands that January night as the Lancers had to fend off a scrappy Newington comeback with the team’s trading back-to-back 3s to close out the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brett Fortier (there’s that last name again) led Eastern with 14 points – canning four three-pointers along the way – and six rebounds while center Jason Clark added 13 points, eight rebounds, and two blocked shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reinaldo Soto, Eastern’s all-time leading rusher in football, posted six points, six rebounds and three assists while Phelan notched 10 points, three rebounds, and three assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Phelan scored half of his points over the final 14.4 seconds of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Archacki added six points and canned two huge free throws down the stretch to give Eastern a late three-point edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington Center Mike Zarotney led all players with 15 points while teammate Juan Ramirez hit for 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joey Serfass, Newington’s top scoring threat, was held to just five points but his late three-pointer tied things up at 46-46 with just under five seconds remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indians, falling to 2-9 overall (0-5 CCC South), played one heck of game that forced Phelan into his late-game heroics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before getting to that busy fourth and final period of play, it was all Eastern early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Lancers started the contest by scoring the first 14 points, the Indians staged a furious comeback, eventually knotting the score late in the fourth quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortier hit two three-pointers in the first quarter while Clark added six points and with just over a minute to go in the frame, Eastern led 14-0 before the Indians finally got on-track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers surged in front 16-4 after one completed frame but after failing to score a point, Newington went on an 18-7 run and with 1:29 left before the half, Eastern’s edge was chopped to 21-18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers held a five-point spread at the break (23-18).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington outscored Eastern again in the third tilt (14-9), but Soto added four points and Fortier hit his third 3 of the game as the Lancers and Indians were all tied up at 32-32 with one quarter remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squads were tied at 39-39 with 4:30 left and late turnovers didn’t allow Eastern to space out any kind of significant lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with less than a minute remaining, Newington’s Carmine Rinaldi (nine points) drained a quick hoop but Archacki – who was fouled and stepped to the free throw line as a 38-percent free throw shooter – calmly sank two charity shots with 30 seconds left to give Eastern a 44-41 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zarotney quickly hit a hoop over Clark and when Newington was forced to foul Phelan, his two free throws extended Eastern’s edge to 46-43 with 14.4 seconds left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of a time out, Serfass canned a huge 3-pointer with 4.6 seconds remaining in regulation that tied the contest up at 46-46.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern got the ball back and Phelan was determined to end the evening without overtime necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Phelan weaved his way to half-court, threw up his game-winning hoop – heaving his shot, ironically, over Serfass – and the 3-pointer swished through as Lancers celebrated their huge 49-46 CCC South victory over the Indians.</p>

<p><strong>Central loses in Overtime</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That same evening, Bristol Central was home against Platt in a huge CCC South tilt and needed overtime to settle their differences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the lone extra period, the Panthers’ Jamel Riddle – another outstanding football player – canned a hoop at the buzzer as Platt came away from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium a 63-61 winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riddle and Central’s Billy Givens each scored 19 points to lead their respective squads offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, Eric Jenkins posted 13 points, Gary Paradis slipped in 12 while Nick Sidney netted 11 as Central had four players in double-figures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt moved to 9-2 over the winning effort while Central fell to 7-4.</p>
