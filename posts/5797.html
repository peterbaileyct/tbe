<p>The raising of the Pride Flag represents&nbsp;hope to achieve inclusivity, equality, respect and awareness in our community, by fostering diversity, unity, visibility and dignity in order to educate, communicate and advocate&nbsp;to build and strengthen community connections.<br><br>June was chosen for LGBT&nbsp;Pride month to commemorate the Stonewall&nbsp;riots, which occurred&nbsp;at the end of June, 1969 and to pay tribute to those involved&nbsp;in&nbsp;six days of protests in an attempt for LGBT+ people to be open about their sexual orientation without fear of arrest.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>As a result of their bravery, many pride events are held during the month of June to recognize the impact LGBT people have had around the world. The rainbow flag symbolizes a variety of characteristics with its current colors of red (life), orange (healing), yellow (sunlight), green (nature), blue (art) and indigo (harmony).</p>
