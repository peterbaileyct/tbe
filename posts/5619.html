<p>BURLINGTON - The hits keep coming for the Bristol Central softball squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And so do the wins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It happened again on Friday evening as the Rams won its seventh straight game, knocking off Lewis Mills by a 14-2 final from Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South tilt saw Central move to 13-3 on the year with one game to play against rival Bristol Eastern next Monday (4 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans fell to 10-8 overall and have dropped two straight - both to Bristol teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, Central’s Gwen Torreso had a huge day from the plate against Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She led the Rams’ offensive attack with four hits, going 4-for-5 overall, with four runs scored and three RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Lorelei Stancavage blasted out a three-run home run and scored two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Sciarretto pitched extremely well, striking out 10 to help the Rams sweep the Spartans this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of state tournament rankings, Central is in the mix with an extremely competitive Class L grouping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as the Rams are winning, so do the opponents ahead of the Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, the Rams are currently in 11th place and should be in that position come tournament time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck, Wethersfield, and Woodstock Academy are all 15-3, enjoying long winning streaks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like Central, Woodstock has won seven straight, Wethersfield has four consecutive wins while Naugy has plastered 13 straight Ws since starting the year at 2-3.</p>
