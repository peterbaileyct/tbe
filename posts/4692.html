<p>CHESHIRE, Conn&nbsp;- &nbsp;Due to the impact of COVID-19 on spring sports schedules, the Council of New England Secondary Schools Principals' Association (CNESSPA) has announced a decision to cancel the 2021 Spring New England Championships.&nbsp;The members of the New England Council voted unanimously 6-0 to cancel the New England Outdoor Track &amp; Field and Golf Championships scheduled for June 2021. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"At this time, there is uncertainty&nbsp;within our states to what will be allowed for interstate travel, multi-team events, and spectator attendance, throughout&nbsp;the spring season. There is also inconsistency among our states in the duration of the spring season to allow for the scheduled dates," said CNESSPA Executive Director Donald Friedman.</p>

<p>Over the past years, the track &amp; field program at Bristol Central has sent several representatives to the NE Outdoor Track &amp; Field event but won't be this June due to the cancellations.</p>
