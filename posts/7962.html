<p>The Lancers answered that goal at 14:30 after Connor Cyr pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area and knocked it to Justin Sanchez, who placed it past Berlin keeper Zach Cancellieri.</p>

<p>Eastern's Andre Gonzalez gave the Lancers a half-time lead cutting in on the weak side and drilling home a Donyell  Maxwell cross at 1:30.  <br></p>

<p>Berlin's high scoring forward, Adam Kozubal (4 goals in Berlin's first game against Maloney), evened the game at 17:30 of the second half when he sent a curling rocket into the upper right hand corner of the Eastern net.   </p>

<p>Both teams had two good shots in the next few minutes,  but the Lancers' shots went wide and Eastern goalie Carlos Portillo slid out to knock out Berlin's attempts .   At 9:24, though, Sanchez broke down the right side and sent the ball across to Adam Borry who hit a hard low ball inside the far post for the game winner.<br>   </p>

<p> "Just a great win that was a total team effort," said Lancer coach Bill Sweet.  "We moved a few players around after our season-opening loss and they responded.  Adam's goal was certainly deserved as he was a tireless performer tonight. Ty Borry, Dylan Piazza, Carter Harris, Connor Cyr, and Preston Guarda on defense frustrated the slick passing Berlin team much of the night."<br>   <br> Cancellieri had 8 saves while Portillo made 6.   Eastern travels to Farmington on Friday for a 6 p.m. game.<br></p>
