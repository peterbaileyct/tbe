<p>The Bristol Edition continues to look back at scholastic sports history in town as today’s focus is on the boys basketball program from Bristol Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 19, 2003, the Rams had their collective hands full against Bloomfield at the Doc Hurley Classic from Weaver High School in Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central dropped its first game the previous day in a 58-50 loss to Northwest Catholic, but in the showdown against the Warhawks, the Rams had a quick reversal of fortunes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that included an outstanding performance by Steve Hasler, a sweet sharp-shooter who was looking for a bit of a bounce-back after going scoreless against Northwest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hasler, who loved to shoot in that old Weaver Gymnasium, dropped in a season-high 31 points as Central defeated Bloomfield by a 64-57 score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first victory of the campaign for the Rams as Hasler blasted in six three-pointers to lead the Bristol aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s team was stacked that season in terms of size, scoring punch and speed (<em>speed</em> when the Rams sat down their nearly 7-foot center).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That squad, who finished the year at 19-6 overall for head coach Pete Wininger, included both D.J. and Aaron Hernandez, Chris Klepps, Nick Michaud, Hasler, and - of course - Jeff ‘Big Deli’ Salovski.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Bloomfield, Hasler canned 10-of-19 shots from the field and went a slick 5-for-5 from the charity stripe to lead all players in scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central needed that scoring outburst from Hasler as Salovski (six points, eight rebounds) was saddled with foul trouble and never got on track during the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D.J. Hernandez might have been known as a football star for Central, but the amazing athlete always did well on the hardwood and against Bloomfield in particular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He once dropped 32 points in a victory at Bloomfield and in the contest from Weaver, Hernandez filled his plate against the Warhawks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hernandez piled up 13 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, and five steals as the Central defense made critical stops throughout the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chris Klepps, possibly the toughest point guard in the CCC South that season, added six points and six assists to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Salovski on the bench, Nick Michaud was extremely productive with the extra playing time - scoring six critical points over first quarter play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also filling in for the foul ridden Central center was Aaron Hernandez and Karl ‘Chopper’ Robinson, as the Rams dug a little deeper down the bench to keep high-scoring Bloomfield guard Saunnie Pilcher from going off offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defense-by-committee approach held Pilcher to just 15 points that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hasler scored eight straight points early in the first quarter to help Central to an imposing 18-5 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central saw its lead pushed to 26-13 through just eight minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Warhawks chopped the deficit at the half and midway through the third frame, Bloomfield was leading by a 35-31 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central’s offense went into overdrive once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, a 19-4 run made it a 50-39 contest and Central was back in charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Bloomfield refused to yield, as an 18-7 jaunt - capped by a lay-in from Pilcher - knotted the affair at 57-57 with less than two minutes to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Warhawks never scored again as Central notched the final seven points of the game, and the Rams came away with an impressive 64-57 win to improve to .500 early on in the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior tandem of D.J. Hernandez and Salovski were impressive in their final year at Bristol Central as both players ended up with over 1,000 points for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hernandez averaged a team-high 21.0 points that season along with 6.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 2.4 steals-per-game before heading off to play football at the University of Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Salovski, playing a season at UMASS before transferring, was the program’s second leading scorer (16.7 points) and led the team in rebounds (9.4) and blocks (4.3) per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Salovski scored 1,269 career points while Hernandez added 1,033 for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hasler was second on the squad in three-pointers made with 38 while averaging 12.1 points, 1.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists and just under one steal a night over the 2003-04 season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aaron Hernandez, in his freshman year, pitched in 9.4 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 2.6 assists-per-game while shooting an amazing 59.6-percent from the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Klepps did a little of everything well for the Rams (5.1 points, 4.4 rebounds, 2.3 steals and a team best 5.1 assists-per-game) while Michaud nearly averaged two points and two rebounds an outing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central only lost to the top teams that year in Central Connecticut Conference play, which included setbacks to Northwest Catholic, Windsor and New Britain during the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In CIAC Division I postseason play, No. 9 Bristol Central defeated No. 24 Brien McMahon by a 68-53 final to open the playoffs while ending the year with a 63-54 loss to No. 8 Bridgeport Central in the second round.</p>
