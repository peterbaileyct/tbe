<p>The Bristol Interfaith Coalition will host its first in-person event in eighteen months on Saturday, July 10 at 10 a.m. </p>

<p>Nighthawk Flying  will lead the group in a traditional Native American ritual for planting. Following that, representatives of many faiths will share prayers or readings reminding us of how all of our spiritual practices and traditions include our obligations to care for our planet.</p>

<p>All are welcome to attend, either to listen or to speak. “Seeds of harmony” will be distributed for attendees to plant in their own gardens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no charge for the event, but all are encouraged to bring non-perishable foods which will be donated to our Bristol soup kitchens and shelters. <br></p>

<p>The Bristol Interfaith Coalition came together several years ago to create events which highlight the commonalities among our faiths’ core values and to help us to learn more about each tradition’s beliefs and practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coalition has hosted and co-hosted many events, including the interfaith Thanksgiving service, Taste of Ramadan, live and web-based presentations for World Interfaith Harmony week, healing ceremonies and more.
