<h2>Have you seen this sign?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don't pull your car all the way to the traffic light in front of the old Nuchie’s Restaurant, you’ll never get a green light to proceed onto East Main, go straight up Central or to take a right onto Broad St. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At least it seems that way.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if your vehicle is off an inch, that light will simply stay red as traffic in the other two directions continues to enjoy green lights (as the sign says, "Forever!")</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good Samaritan decided to hang a sign with a very important FYI -- telling drivers to pull up to the sign in order to "trip" the traffic light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We don't know who hung the sign, but we thought it is worth noticing.</p>
