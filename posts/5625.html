<p>The Bristol boys lacrosse coop continued its successful trek through the 2021 campaign with another victory on Thursday, spinning Suffield-Windsor Locks by a 14-7 final on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the sixth win for the program as the outfit entered its match at Edwin O. Smith on Saturday with a stellar 6-3 ledger in hand</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol assistant coach Logan Geller said that the program’s seven-goal win over Suffield was&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“arguably their most impressive victory of the season.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a stunning comeback by Bristol as the Suffield came out on fire at the start, snaring a 6-3 edge at the half as the home team dominated both sides of the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“However, once the second half began, everything changed,” said Geller. “The boys from Bristol were inspired by the incredible effort of Alexander Brand and rose to the occasion. After kickstarting the offense with [a goal] from team captain Jeffery Taillon (four goals overall), Bristol could not be stopped.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals went on a blazing 11-1 run to silence the Suffield sideline and dominated the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Bristol’s defensive front of Jakub Warszawik, Somaneen Kheav, Sam Anderle, and captain Jack Stavens held the Suffield offense to just seven goals on just over 20 attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the team’s outstanding keeper, Max Stavens, had a little boost of energy to ‘stave’ of the Suffield contingent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Coming off of his second dose of the covid-19 vaccine, goalkeeper Max Stavens was absolutely locked in,” said Geller. “He made 14 saves and nearly assisted one of Bristol’s transition goals and was a key piece of the Bristol clear.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attackman Ayden Cross, Nathan Shorette, Andrew Spina, and Tristan Kindblom managed the game perfectly up to the last second for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spina made some incredible feeds while Cross tallied a beautiful behind the back goal as Bristol overwhelmed Suffield offensively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Shorette’s speed is an asset that Bristol looks to employ throughout the end of their season,” said Geller. “It is [also] impossible to forget about commanding midfielder D’Andre Wiggins. When he runs down the field, the offense opens up and he simply facilitates every action carried out throughout the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[And] from clearing, to defending, and even scoring, long stick midfielder Dylan Brown led the team in caused turnovers and had some hockey assists.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Geller and the Bristol boys lacrosse squad are poised for a big finish this season and expect big things once the state tournaments commences with the CIAC Playdowns taking place on Saturday, May 29.</p>
