<p>In a statement from the Mayor's office, Bristol remains in the Orange status for the second week with 52 other communities including Burlington, Farmington and Newington. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The labels are based on the testing and infection rates from the 2 week period of October 11 - 24th.  Those total cases are divided by 14 (days) for a daily average. That daily average is then divided by the city/town's population and then multiplied by 100,000. Towns over 15% per 100,000 are moved to Red. Bristol is currently at 11.5%.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mayor had a debrief call with Health Director Marco Palmeri and Superintendent of Schools Kate Carbone and Deputy Superintendent Michael Dietter after the weekly Dept of Public Health call this afternoon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are imploring everyone to take the proper precautions</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The list of recommendations include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*         Avoid large events and limit time with non-family members</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*         Groups, Clubs and youth sports organizations are encouraged to postpone and/or cancel events. All groups should only conduct activities where masks and social distancing  can be maintained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*         The Bristol Public Schools will continue to enforce protocols that will allow in-person learning to continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Businesses and restaurants need to uphold strict adherence to their Sector Rules. Bars that are masquerading as restaurants are contributing to increased infection spread rates. The mayor has not yet named an Enforcement person to issue infractions for violations of Executive Orders, but will do so if there are reports about restaurants who are lax in their social distancing of tables, mask-wearing of staff or other mediocre efforts. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> If we as a state go above a 6% infection rate, there is a very good chance the Governor will roll everyone back to Phase 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayor Zoppo-Sassu and the City Council have been working with the Governor's Office to identify resources to add additional testing sites to Bristol. Currently, the Community Health Center is offering free PCR testing (results take 2-3 days) and many pharmacies also have tests available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Citizens should consider being tested, even if they are asymptomatic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Halloween should be approached with caution, in small groups of related family members only, with candy distributed from a distance. In-home parties should be avoided. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current limit for private gatherings - whether indoor or outdoor is 25 people. Even that is being discouraged at this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also today, one Bristol Police Officer has tested positive and is in isolation. He has mild symptoms and there is a second police officer who has been identified as a close contact who has been put into Quarantine. In an unrelated case, a Firefighter has also been identified as a close contact of someone who has recently tested positive and will be quarantining effective today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mayor's office will continue to balance essential services - like Friday's Farms to Family drive up food distribution and Saturday's last Farmers Market on Saturday morning - against the backdrop of curtailing other activities and encouraging Bristol residents to continue to do what is needed to protect themselves, those around them, and the overall community.<br>--</p>
