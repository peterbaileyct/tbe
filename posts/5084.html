<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Eastern baseball team proved to be an irritant to Maloney on Saturday but in the end, the Spartans nabbed a 3-1 edge after one stanza and never looked back, winning by a final score of 9-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest, played from Maloney High School in Meriden, was the opener for both squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern veteran Andrew Lozier played extremely well offensively, zipping up three hits - including two triples - while scoring three times to pace the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then a new addition helped the Eastern charge as Matt D'Amato blasted out three of the Lancers’ nine hits, all singles, while adding three RBI to the till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Tyler Martin drew a tough loss on the mound while John Umbach roped up the victory for the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several players tallied multiple hits for Maloney but to commence play, the Lancers drew first blood in the top of the first frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier connected on a two-out triple to right-center and when D’Amato roped up his first varsity single, Lozier scored to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Spartans struck right back over the bottom of the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three unearned runs crossed the plate and Lancers never held the advantage again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the first frame, Maloney loaded the bases via a double, base-on-balls, and an infield error, before a wild pitch allowed a runner to score to tie the contest at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with two gone, Maloney’s Ted Hinewski’s two-strike single up the middle scored two additional runs, as the home team nabbed a 3-1 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The score remained 3-1 into the top of the fourth when Eastern notched a run to get back into things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers threatened to retake the game as D’Amato and Tyler Stickels singled while a base-on-balls loaded things up with no one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Jaydon Churchill nabbed an RBI via a sacrifice fly, trimming the deficit to 3-2, but the visitors did not score again over the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney scored two more runs in the bottom of the fourth to help the squad snare a 5-2 lead after four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fifth, Lozier tripled with one gone and scored on a sacrifice fly by Martin that made it a 5-3 game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But two more Maloney tallies stretched out the deficit to 7-3 after five completed innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Eastern had an answer in the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pinch hitter Ryan Fradette singled with one out, seizing second base on a miscue in the outfield.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He later came around to score on an infield error - chopping the deficit to 7-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans held a 9-4 lead through six as a two-run inning spaced the deficit out to five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the top of the seventh stanza, Eastern went back to work - putting a dent in the final deficit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, the Lancers loaded the bases with no one out and D’Amato dropped in a two-run single, chopping the score to 9-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern could not generate another run-scoring hit, losing the contest by three in the end.</p>
