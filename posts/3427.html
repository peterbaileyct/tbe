<p>The Bristol Edition finishes its series on Bristol’s annual Battle for the Bell with a special look at the Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern showdowns from the 21st Century.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central Connecticut Conference had been growing strong since 1984 and fast forward to 2019, the CCC was as impressive as ever.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, there were problems with a certain squad from New Britain running up scores but in terms of BC/BE wars, there were plenty of competitive battles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The start of the century saw Central with the talent advantage as Timmy Washington and the Hernandez brothers (D.J. and Aaron) ran amuck over the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after Aaron Hernandez left to play in Florida, Eastern had its best stretch of victories against its longest pigskin rival.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had gridiron warriors like Tommy Tarantino, Ray Ortiz, Tyrell Holmes, and several others that finally saw the series flip to Eastern’s side in a big way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that series edge ping-ponged right back to the Rams’ favor as of late.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is currently riding a five-game winning streak over Eastern – halting a stretch of eight consecutive Lancers’ victories over the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Happy Thanksgiving as the four-part series on The Battle for the Bell concludes, at least for now.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of BC/BE battles of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, here’s how the records played out:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BC wins</strong>:&nbsp;11&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BE wins</strong>: 8&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ties</strong>:&nbsp;1&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Year/Victor/Score&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2000 — Bristol Central, 39-0</strong>&nbsp;– Five touchdowns and 353 rushing yards by All-State talent Timmy Washington saw Central win easily over Eastern. The five Thanksgiving Day TD’s and 353 yards were a holiday record.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2001 — Bristol Central, 36-12</strong>&nbsp;– Washington notches four touchdowns – going for 242 yards on 22 rushes – as the Rams won again.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2002 — Bristol Central, 38-0</strong>&nbsp;– Eastern doesn’t generate a point over the next three Thanksgiving Day games as D.J. Hernandez and Breyone Evans combined for 256 yards on 36 carries over another blowout victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2006 — Tie, 14-14</strong>&nbsp;– On a messy day with wind, snow, and rain – and Central needing a victory to qualify for the playoffs – Eastern held Aaron Hernandez in check as the teams drew a 14-14 stalemate and left the Rams hanging at 8-1-1 on the year – just out of the state tournament picture. The teams shared the bell and it was the first time since 1998 that the Lancers enjoyed their Turkey Day effort. Eastern committed 10 fumbles in the showdown but still managed to keep pace with Central.&nbsp;</p>

Rosa ended the day with 31 rushes for 171 yards and five touchdowns – tied for the most TD’s scored in a Thanksgiving Day game along with Timmy Washington (2000).
