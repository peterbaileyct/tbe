<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern boys soccer team’s start to the 2021 campaign has seen the locals take on several of the top squads in the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday’s showdown against South Windsor was no different as the Lancers had another tough program to battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this one, South Windsor's Bryan Fishman scored three goals as the Bobcats snared a 3-1 victory over Eastern from Alumni Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the win, South Windsor moved to 2-0-1 overall while Eastern fell to 1-3.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fishman scored a goal at the 25:24 mark of the first period from the left side, beating a defender to a loose ball and spiking it in the goal to give the Bobcats a 1-0 edge.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Eastern eventually tied things up before the completion of the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two minutes left in the first frame, Ty Borry sent a ball through to Dom Femiak – hustling by two defenders – to notch his second goal of the season as the match was a 1-1 stalemate at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But South Windsor scored twice in the second period to make it academic.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fishman broke the tie with 15 minutes left in regulation as he cut inside an Eastern defender and placed the ball past Lancers’ keeper Carlos Portillo (six saves) – scoring the game-winning goal and making it a 2-1 contest.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had chances once again to draw even but crosses and corner kicks couldn't find the right feet while Fishman added an insurance goal late in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He sealed the victory with eight minutes to go, drilling a hard shot into the right side of the net as the Bobcats came away with a 3-1 victory on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We played hard, but failed to stay with our men consistently," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "Our communication has to get better on both the offensive and defensive ends of the field."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor keeper Mike Holmes made eight saves to help stave off the Lancers’ attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s next match is on Friday at 3:45 p.m. as the locals will battle Platt in a CCC South confrontation.</p>
