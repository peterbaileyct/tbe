<p>This past winter, the Central Connecticut Conference broke its boys basketball teams into four different divisions, keeping teams local due to the raging pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with those programs completing their campaign, several players were recognized for their play as CCC All-Conference honorees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And between Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern, four total players earned postseason accolades for their efforts in CCC, Region B.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central junior Donovan Clingan, senior Sean Wininger and junior Damion Glasper all zipped up out-of-season accolades while at Eastern, senior Elijah Parent was named to the Region B squad for his excellent efforts in 2021.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had three players take home postseason honors which was tied for the season highest total in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over in CCC, Region C, four players from East Catholic made the CCC All-Conference team - the most of any program in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That list included Brody Limric, Luke Strole, Matt Houde, and Jaidan Gilzene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles were 14-1, losing to just Bristol Central (69-68, OT) in the CCC Tournament championship game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Region A, Northwest Catholic and Windsor each had three players earn all-conference honors as the programs combined to lose just three games this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in Region D, three players from both Platt and Maloney of Meriden took home postseason honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
