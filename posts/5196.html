<p>The total capacity for the project, located at 399 Hill Street, will be 3.25 megawatts, which translates to 6,235 megawatt hours per year, enough to power 746 average homes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was estimated that the entire project would be completed in six months with a completion date in July, so it appears as if things are right on schedule.</p>

<p>Once operational, the City of Bristol will receive annual tax revenues from Verogy, the company building and running the site, for an estimated 20 years.</p>
