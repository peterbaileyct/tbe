<p>BRISTOL – It might have taken a week or two, but the Bristol American Legion baseball team is in second place of the Zone 1 standings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that slot holds some significant weight to it in terms of the Regional Qualifier and an automatic bid into postseason play (more on that in TBE Sports Sunday).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is once again the hottest team in the zone, winning its last three games while posting a strong 9-4 Zone 1 ledger overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout the zone, several teams must make up games and, in the process, some of the top programs will lose a game or two along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All these other teams, they've got a lot of games to make up," said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. "They're going to be crunched together."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 9-4 ledger has the Bristol team just a half-game out of first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford (8-2 Zone 1, 9-2 overall) has been the Zone 1 leader for quite some time this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden, who was on a nifty five-game winning streak, had its luck snapped on Monday, falling to Avon by a 7-5 final – dropping to third place at 6-3.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon (6-4) is in fourth place and Naugatuck (5-4) resides in fifth to complete the top five of Zone 1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each one of those squads must make-up games to draw even with Bristol in terms of games played.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all those contests to go, expect more downward movement from the top teams in Zone 1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We've played 13 zone games. I don't think anyone's played more than" ten games said LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If everything goes off without a hitch today, the Zone 1 schedule sees Avon at Newington (4-6), West Hartford at Berlin, while Meriden must deal with Simsbury twice today in a doubleheader from Memorial Field in Simsbury. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury (0-6) is truly due for its first win of the campaign and with two showdowns against Meriden, the opportunity to seize that victory is at hand.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol, with its Zone 1 leading nine wins, will just let the rest of the division figure it out on its own while taking care of its own business later in the week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We've already got those wins in the bank," said LaPenta. "You can't take those away. It's nice."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pitch count status&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of Wednesday, Bristol’s Matt Beaucar is eligible to pitch on Wednesday as is Alex Canzellarini.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And big Mike Lorenzetti can throw as soon as Thursday but will probably be held off until the weekend with a showdown against Avon looming.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar threw just 57 pitches in Bristol’s 11-1 demolition of Simsbury this past Sunday and could be pressed into duty on Thursday as Post 2 travels to Hall high school in West Hartford to battle the Zone 1 leader over a huge clash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams split the regular season this year, 1-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On the schedule&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the entanglement with West Hartford on Thursday, Post 2 is home for a game against Newington at 7 p.m. from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in an anticipated rematch, Bristol travels to Buckingham Field on Sunday to square off against Avon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 5:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juniors win&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Sunday, after the senior squad took care of business, the juniors got to the pay window as well – sinking Simsbury by a 6-2 final from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol used an eight-hit attack to snare its second victory of the season (2-6) as Bristol chucker Ryan Maglio threw a four-hitter over a solid 97-pitch performance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 scored single runs in the first and third innings before adding two in the fourth to make it a 4-0 contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury nabbed a two-spot in the bottom of the fifth but solitary runs by Bristol in the sixth and seventh frames made it a four-run deficit for Post 84.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
