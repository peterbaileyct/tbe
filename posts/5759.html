<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central baseball team, the No. 16 ranked squad in the CIAC Class L bracket in 2021, didn’t have a cupcake first round opponent when No. 17 Farmington came to town on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Rams defeated the River Hawks by 19 runs in their second game of regular season play, the postseason rematch was a much closer affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central played extremely well in the field, took advantage of several Farmington errors and miscues while scoring early and late over a very satisfying 5-1 victory from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won its tenth game of the season (10-6) while Farmington ended the year at 11-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sean Wininger had a rough start on the mound for the Rams but once his defense made some plays behind him, the senior dug in, tallied several critical strikeouts (five), allowing just four hits overall – going the distance over another complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Sean did a great job,” said Central coach Bunty Ray. “He actually came out and he didn’t have his best stuff. But then he turned it around, started throwing to contact, started throwing strikes, and that was great defense, great defense [behind him].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington’s Brendan Kelly battled to the end as well, allowing Central just seven hits, but his defense made several miscues behind him, leading to a tough loss. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger walked the first batter he faced in the game off four straight balls and after a quick trip to the mound from his coach, the senior got to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He fanned two straight and then Central catcher Chris Osuch threw out the runner going to second base for a strikeout-throw-out double-play and the locals were quickly up to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out in the bottom of the first, Adam Caron ran out an infield hit to third, Lorenzetti smashed a ball down the third-base line for a double and Wininger was plunked by a pitch to load things up.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frank Spirito then poked a ball that was headed for right field, but the first baseman just gloved it – slowing it down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second baseman then threw it away and a wild throw to home plate led to two straight errors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron easily scored on the play and Lorenzetti scooted home on one of the errors to make it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The name of the game is to make sure you are putting the ball in play to give yourself opportunities,” said Ray. “[There] wasn’t a whole lot of strikeouts [and] there were a couple right-at-them balls that really in the beginning, could have given us some breathing room but, obviously, that just hasn’t worked out for us this year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a line-drive to third base led to a double-play as the Rams left the inning ahead by a 2-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in the top of the second frame, the River Hawks attacked and cut the deficit in half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off back-to-back singles, Farmington’s Nate Watson drew a walk as the bases were loaded with no outs on the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EJ Sanchez earned a four-ball walk to score a run, but three quick outs squashed the rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben Zink dropped a grounder to Wininger on the hill, starting a 1-2-3 double play and J.T. Clark made a great throw to first on a Chad Rizzo grounder to short as Central allowed just a single run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central escaped a huge jam, still leading by a run at 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington’s Cole Caccamo nabbed an infield hit to short as the third inning commenced – the third straight frame the River Hawks had its leadoff runner on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central generated three quick outs to end the stanza while Lorenzetti hustled out an infield hit to short – his second tally of the game – trying to get something going in the bottom of the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A botched pickoff play allowed Lorenzetti to move to sound base and into scoring position, but Wininger struck out and Spirito’s nifty liner to second was just scooped in for the final play of the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It remained a 2-1 game as Kelly was holding the fort for the River Hawks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The first time we played them [in the 20-1 win on April 17], they didn’t throw they best pitchers,” said Ray of Farmington. “We just caught lightning in a bottle. I knew this was going to be a battle. I know what their coach does, and I know how hard he works his kids. [Kelly] was very good. He’s a good competitor.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kelly opened the fourth with a one-hopper to centerfield but off a fielder’s choice and a 5-4-3 double play, the inning was quickly completed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Zach Vanasse (2-for-3) slipped in a two-out single in the bottom of the fourth for his second hit of the afternoon but did not advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington went 1-2-3 in the fifth as Wininger retired five straight while Central also was retired in order during the bottom of the tilt but the Rams were just six out away from ending the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone in the fifth, Wininger hit a batter, but pinch runner Luke Watson never advanced as Spirito made a great catch on Kelly’s line-drive to third base to end things as the Rams’ 2-1 edge carried into the middle of the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We haven’t always made plays for him all year. Sean should have three or four more wins, but Sean doesn’t complain,” said Ray. “He just goes out there and does his job. Today, I was glad the defense was able to keep up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the sixth, Central went for three runs to ice the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger led off with a walk as Michael Allan came in to pinch run for his pitcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He moved to second on a Spirito ground-out and when Jacoby Banks drilled a liner off Kelly on the hill for an infield hit, runners were on the corners for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Matt Beaucar tallied an important insurance run as his fielder’s choice to second scored Allan to make it a 3-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the play, the ball was thrown towards second bases but ended up in the outfield as two runners were on with one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A passed ball advanced the duo and when Ryan Ring slapped a ball over the head of the second baseman, he cleared the bases as the two-RBI tally helped Central secured a 5-1 push as Wininger looked to close the event out in the top of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We got some good at-bats,” said Ray. “Getting those extra runs, everybody could breathe easier a little bit, especially after you get the first out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanchez dropped a flare into right to put one on with one out in the seventh, but Wininger snuffed out the rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a game-ending strikeout, Central had its 5-1 win in hand and advanced in tournament play to square off against top-seeded Daniel Hand in what should be an epic battle between two very good programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A lot of things have happened to us” this year said Ray. “We made a pact and said, ‘hey listen, let’s go out and take it. Let’s not let anything beat us.’ A lot of times, we had that look on our face, but it was good to see these guys come out and really say to themselves ‘we’re going to go out and win this game defensively for Sean.’”</p>
