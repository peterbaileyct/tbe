<p>On Monday, I got online to check to see if my absentee ballot had been received. I fumbled around on the Secretary of State website before googling, “How do I find out if my absentee ballot has been received&nbsp;Connecticut?” I clicked on the first link, which I provide here:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portaldir.ct.gov/sots/LookUp.aspx" target="_blank">https://portaldir.ct.gov/sots/LookUp.aspx</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And I found myself on a very simple and somewhat old-fashioned website with the seal of the Office of the Secretary of State, with the secretary of state's name and photo across the top. Below, that the words, “Voter Registration Lookup.” Below that, a few prompts: city/town, last name, first name, date of birth. I filled them in and clicked the search button. </p>

<p>What I found? My absentee ballot application was processed on Sept. 25, and my ballot was received on Oct 6. From what I understand that ballot will have to wait to be counted until Election Day. If I were voting in person, I also found my polling site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It appears to me that the system works. At the same time, I am fully aware that mail-in voting is different and that we should expect that votes will not all be counted on Election Day and that we may not be able to name a winner for some time afterwards. That's fine. And truth be told, rarely in the past have all the votes been counted the same day. This past city-wide election in District 3 resulted in a recount before a winner might be named.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was at the main library recently and on the way out I bumped into one of the librarians as she was setting out some books for the grab and go—the library's version of takeout.  It's changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Used to be, just a short while ago when the library was closed to patrons, I would call in or go online and request a book and a staff member would brown paper bag the books, put my my name on the bag and place it on a folding table set up in the foyer for me to pick up. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That system has been replaced with some school lockers. Call in or go online. Request your books. Now, rather than being browned bagged, the books go into the lockers, which have a coded lock. You get a message that your books are ready for pickup, along with the code. Slip in the door, put in your code, grab your books and go. </p>

<p>I used this service often enough in the past. It worked&nbsp;pretty well. I am guessing this new one will too. I plan on using it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on this day, though, rather than using grab and go, I decided to go into the building, where I masked up and followed the arrows to the&nbsp;book shelves&nbsp;and grabbed the books myself. I love libraries, I love all those books on shelves, I love browsing through them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And&nbsp;so&nbsp;I did, quietly. Of course, there weren't many patrons around, which was fine with me. I did not encounter anyone in the stacks. When I got to the circulation desk to check out, I did not have to wait in line, and the staff, now sequestered behind plexiglass, checked out my books and even updated my card.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next time, though, as I said, I will call in and try out the new grab and go system. It seems under the strain of COVID, I often get absent-minded, or should I say, distracted. I forget stuff, as I hurry through the motions, forget things—later on the same day, I left a can of tuna at the checkout at the grocery store because I was “distracted.” </p>
