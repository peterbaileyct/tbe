<p>In recognition of AIDS Awareness month, Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu has released a proclamation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Mayor’s Task Force on HIV/AIDS will commemorate AIDS Awareness month with a virtual vigil on October 22.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Task Force has held a candlelight vigil each October for about thirty years. Due to Covid, it was held virtually on their Facebook site last year. This year a similar virtual event will be held.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All in the Bristol area are invited to remember those affected by, living with or who have passed from HIV/AIDS. October 22, 2021 has been designated as the observance date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of a live Candlelight Vigil, the Task Force asks you to post a photo of yourself with a message or a photo of a person who you are remembering on that day. The names and messages will be added to the Bristol quilt panel which will be submitted to the National AIDS Quilt when complete. On Facebook, search for The City of Bristol Mayor's Task Force on HIV/AIDS.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Task Force meets monthly and was created over thirty years ago. It serves to provide information about HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C through multiple events annually. <br></p>
