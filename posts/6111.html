<p>The city of Bristol will renew the “Trash to Treasure” program this coming Saturday at the Farmers’ Market at Centre Square.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last year, the employees at the Transfer Station have been putting items in gently used condition aside, and not sending them to Covanta for incineration. </p>

<p>“On Saturday, we will be bringing two large containers to the rear of the Farmers Market and opening them up for members of the public to take for free,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “Bristol residents can come and grab items that they can use. All items are on a first-come, first-served basis, and must be taken that day. There are some large items, so residents are encouraged to bring a truck, or have access to one if there are items that they need to transport.”</p>
