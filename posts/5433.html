<p>The praise continues to be heaped on Bristol Central All-State center Donovan Clingan as he continues to his outstanding play on the AAU basketball circuit with Team Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stellar Hoops (@StellarHoops) made a very good assessment of the center on Saturday night via Twitter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Class of 2022, 7-foot-1 [center] Donovan Clingan asserts himself with good position inside the perimeter, can make shots, good passer in the post, physical on both ends, finishes above the rim &amp; tough rebounder. [He] holds offers from Michigan, Boston College &amp; more.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s interesting which colleges the author decided to highlight in his tweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though you’re limited in characters in using Twitter, Michigan and Boston College were the colleges that were mentioned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michigan coach Juwan Howard, the Big Ten Coach of the Year, thinks he has a great chance to land the big man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where does Boston College land on his list of eight schools? The ACC is an excellent conference for hoops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Locally, the Syracuse and UCONN programs think they have a great chance in landing Clingan but the Big Ten has been an amazing conference for big men over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll make future visits to his eight schools of choice and Clingan will decide his basketball fate later in the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Are Bristol Greeners making a comeback in Tri-State?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tri-State Baseball League will be swinging back into action on Sunday, May 23 and the program is looking forward to the 2021 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2020 season was called off due to the pandemic but the wooden bat league is ready for a full slate of games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Squads from Northwest Connecticut and as far as New York make up the league and one of the entries is from our city - the Bristol Greeners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The league is expecting 14 teams to take the field this year and, in the past, the Bristol and Terryville entries have been consistent playoff performers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners played in a shoreline league last year and the hope is the band will be brought back as the program has been a staple in Tri-State since 2009.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there are some surprises in store for the 2021 season as the league is going to compete against teams from other men’s leagues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are also entertaining regular season games with the CTL,” according to the Tri-State website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The AABC state tournament and World Series will once again commence along with the 14 team Tri-State Playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If AJ Lorenzetti and Jerry LaPenta are up to it, the Bristol Greeners could be playing once again in Tri-State play.</p>
