Part 3 of the conversation between Hal Kilby, Jack Krampitz, Michele Roalf and me covers staggering the terms for Board of Education members and changes to the Personnel Office.

Jack's dog, Dusty (named after the Boston Red Sox's Dustin Pedroia) makes his appearance. Listen carefully and you will hear his collar jangling as he circles the diningroom table at the Krampitz residence where the conversation was recorded.
