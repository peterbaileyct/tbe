<p>Several readers contacted us last week with the concern about the methods of payment offered to subscribers of TBE.  Specifically, they wanted to use a credit card to make their monthly subscription payment, and the only method we were offering was Paypal.</p>

<p>You spoke;  we listened. If you try to subscribe now, the site will now offer both Credit Cards and  Paypal as options to join. If you click on ”BECOME A MEMBER”, you will have the two options to choose.</p>

<p>As all the Televangelists say, ”Give now and give often!” (just kidding, sort of)</p>
