<p>Bristol Eastern (4-1-2) scored the winning goal with 34 seconds left on the clock to defeat Plainville (5-2) by a 2-1 score Friday afternoon at Bristol Eastern.  The Lancers responded to Plainville's challenges with solid defense throughout the game.   </p>

<p>The Lancers struck first, 28:35 into the initial half, as Joe Verardi slipped a pass to a cutting Dom Femiak who scored into the near side of the goal.  </p>

<p>Plainville's ball control gave them more time of possession in the first half, but the Lancer back line, especially Brandon Greger and Andrew Lozier, frustrated them in the final defensive third.    </p>

<p>The second half was much of the same until the Blue Devil's Patrick Gryszewski broke free on the left side and sent a cross that Avery Palma knocked home  with 6:30 left in the game.   </p>

<p>Then with 1:05 to play, Tyler Borry had a pass deflected out of bounds and Joe Verardi took the resulting corner kick.  Verardi's kick was perfectly placed, and Luke Hammer arrived at the edge of the area and headed a hard shot past Plainville goalie Nathan Masco at :34.   <br>    </p>

<p>"We really earned this win across the board," said Lancer coach Bill Sweet.  From the backs to the forwards, we dug down and beat a well-coached team.   Standing out by their tireless work rate in the middle of the field were Elijah Parent and Adam Borry."<br></p>

<p>Masco had 7 saves while Eastern's Nate Diloreto made 5.     </p>
