<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern baseball ‘revenge tour’ continued Friday as the Lancers and Plainville Blue Devils duked it out in a CCC South classic from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And seven innings wouldn’t be enough in this one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squads battled to a 10-10 stalemate, going into the bottom of the ninth, before Eastern put away the game for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ryan Fradette smacked a double to the gap in left-center – scoring Tyler Martin – as the Lancers won their second game in a row, sinking Plainville by an 11-10 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (5-13) kept its state tournament hopes alive while Plainville fell to 8-10 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on April 24, the Blue Devils were able to top Eastern by the same 11-10 score, making a seventh inning comeback to nab a huge win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, history favored the home squad once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tied at 10-10 in the bottom of the ninth, Eastern's Tyler Martin walked with one out to put the winning run on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He later stole second and tagged the dish when Fradette slapped his two-base hit into left to propel the Lancers to the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Martin had a two-run double,&nbsp;Ben D'Amato flipped in two hits – including a two-run double – Cameron Moore had a clutch two run single in the eighth to tie the game at 10-10 while Trevor Nohilly collected three hits to pace the offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Tyler Bonney spaced two singles, including a run scoring base hit in the eighth, Mike Bakaysa laid down a perfect squeeze bunt to score another run in the eighth, and Alec Couture collected two singles and an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Blue Devils, Brennan Staubley added a key run scoring double in the seventh, and Matt Lagassey nabbed singles in both the eighth and ninth frames, scoring a run in the eighth, as the visitors refused to give in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Logan Schenck, who came in to pitch with one out in the eighth, threw the final 1.2 innings to earn the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this contest hung in the balance throughout as each team made comebacks before Eastern drew the victory in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was 1-1 through one inning of play but in the second, Eastern went ahead by two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two outs, Nohilly beat out an infield single to short, stole second, and ended up on third via a wild pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill then walked and stole second, putting two runners in scoring position, and Martin followed with a double over&nbsp;the centerfielder’s head to score both runners – making it a 3-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 3-1 push lasted into the fifth frame before the Blue Devils dropped in four runs to give Plainville a 5-3 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk, a hit-by-pitch, and an infield error loaded the bases with no outs for the Blue Devils and Brayden Moore relieved Churchill on the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville scored a run on a fielder's choice grounder to third by Alec Couture and Brennan Staubley's sacrifice fly produced a tally to tie things up at 3-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Callahan then singled in two runs as Plainville grabbed a 5-3 push for a lead that would not last long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fifth, the Lancers tied things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk to D'Amato opened the tilt and when Tyler Stickels hit a hard grounder over second, the ball deflected into short right center as both runners ended up in scoring position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A groundout scored pinch runner Gabe Bartolome and Nohilly's second consecutive infield single near second base scored Stickels to make it a 5-5 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in sixth, Eastern scored two runs to snare a 7-5 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Lozier's fly ball was dropped for a two-base error, Fradette drew a base-on-balls and D’Amato slipped a two-run double over the right fielder's head and now leading by two, Eastern was just three outs away from closing the event out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Plainville had other ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils tied the game up in the seventh and then Plainville scored three more runs in the eighth to snare a 10-7 cushion – forcing Eastern to respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Couture opened the seventh with a single to left and Staubley followed with an RBI double to right-center, making it a 7-6 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Staubley then stole third and scored the tying run on a sacrifice fly by Jayden Cumbo as it was a brand-new game at 7-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern did not produce a run in the bottom of the seventh, and then the fun began in the eighth for the Blue Devils.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Matt Lagassey opened the frame with a single to left, Owen Leander followed with a perfect sacrifice bunt down the first base line with no possible play on the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two runners on, Bonney singled to left to score&nbsp;Lagassey as Plainville snared an 8-7 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bakaysa followed with a perfect squeeze bunt on the first pitch, scoring Leander for an RBI tally.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Couture was then hit-by-pitch as Schenck came into throw for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two outs, Callahan singled to left to score Bonney and Plainville went into the bottom of the eighth with a 10-7 lead in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, it was Eastern’s turn to respond with Couture on the hill as the bottom of the eighth commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers got a run back on three walks and a hit batter – making it a 10-8 game – before confusion took over the contest with the bases loaded for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out, Cameron Moore drilled a liner to right-center and the fielder made a diving catch in what turned into a bang-bang play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the catch was never singled by the officials, the runners were in motion and on the bizarre play – which Plainville contested was a caught ball – Eastern scored twice to knot the contest up at 10-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That score remained intact into the bottom of the ninth when Fradette generated the game-winning hit as Eastern came away from Muzzy field a 11-10 victor.</p>
