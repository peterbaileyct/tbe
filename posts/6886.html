<p>The Rockwell Park summer concert series returned Tuesday night to the amphitheater with a large, enthusiastic audience to see&nbsp;Soul Sound Revue.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the first notes of the opening tune,&nbsp;<em>Signed, Sealed Delivered</em>,&nbsp;<em>I’m Yours</em>, the crowd was singing and dancing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the drums and bass laying down some funky grooves and spot-on vocals and harmonies from its three lead vocalists, the nine-piece piece band recreated Motown hits of the 60s’, 70s, and 80s.&nbsp; The tight and polished set provided a good vibe throughout.&nbsp;<br></p>
