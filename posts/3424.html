<p>The City of Bristol is launching a marketing campaign to make the community aware that they can shop safely from the comfort of their own homes&nbsp;this holiday season while&nbsp;supporting many Bristol businesses and nonprofits.&nbsp;The social media campaign is called #ShopBristolCT and will feature several Bristol businesses along with local nonprofits that the community can patronize online.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Encouraging residents to shop locally is a consistent theme throughout the year and particularly during the holiday season,” said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu.&nbsp;“This year the message continues with an increased focus on local e-commerce&nbsp;here in Bristol.” </p>

<p><br>The campaign will start with encouraging the community to shop locally on Small Business Saturday on November 28 and will continue throughout the month of December to highlight several Bristol businesses and nonprofits. <br></p>

<p>“With many online shopping options you will be able to purchase something for everyone on your holiday gift-giving list this year,” stated Dawn Nielsen, Marketing &amp; Public Relations Specialist for the City of Bristol.&nbsp;“Be sure to follow the Bristol All Heart social media channels: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to see the many options and gift-giving ideas.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with the many businesses with online shopping capabilities, the community is also encouraged to consider giving monetary donations to local nonprofits in memory of or in honor of loved ones on Giving Tuesday, a national day of giving, which is on December 1. Both the Main Street Community Foundation and the United Way of West Central Connecticut have COVID-19 Response Funds to provide rapid response grants to nonprofits to meet the basic needs of residents, as well as general operating support grants to local organizations. These efforts will continue into 2021 and beyond. To learn more and to make an online donation, visit their websites: <a href="https://www.mainstreetfoundation.org/">https://www.mainstreetfoundation.org</a> and <a href="https://www.uwwestcentralct.org/">https://www.uwwestcentralct.org</a>.</p>
