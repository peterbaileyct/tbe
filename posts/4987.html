<p>After winning the Central Connecticut Conference boys basketball tournament championship last Friday over East Catholic, would the squad from Bristol Central become the top ranked program in the state?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you run the CCC gauntlet, coming out an unscathed 3-0 during championship week against three of top four ranked squads in the state, the Rams deserved the No. 1 billing in all of Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crew over at GameTimeCT agreed as Central - in the final boys basketball poll of the year - earned the top ranking, leap-frogging over East Catholic, Northwest Catholic and Windsor - all squads the Rams defeated along the way in claiming the CCC title win last week over an amazing five-day stretch with the victories over Northwest and East Catholic coming on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>State media, who helps determine the poll, gave Central (15-0) most of the first place votes, seizing 17 out of the 19 possible ballots awarded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GameTimeCT voting system is tabulated on a 30-28-26-24-22-20-18-16-14-12-11-10-9-8-7 point basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central ended up with 566 points and moved up from fifth place two weeks ago to the No. 1 slot to end the scholastic year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sacred Heart, finishing the season at 14-0, earned the other two first place votes and ended things with 500 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Heartsâ€™ program will be no more at the end of the school year as the institution from Waterbury is closing its doors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Catholic (14-1, 484 points) was bounced from the top spot via the 69-68 overtime loss to Bristol Central in the title tilt while Northwest Catholic (13-1, 430) also fell to the Rams (71-60) in CCC Tournament play last Wednesday - dropping down to fourth in the final poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ridgefield (15-1, 404) placed fifth, Notre Dame-Fairfield (11-1, 392) was voted in at sixth while West Haven (12-1, 340) - not ranked last week - won the SCC Division I title and nabbed seventh place overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor (11-2, 313), the first team Central hung a loss on last week, dropped from fourth to eighth, Prince Tech went undefeated (15-0, 256) and earned ninth place while Kolbe Cathedral (13-1, 254) fell from sixth to tenth to round out the poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Morgan (15-0) and Capital Prep (14-0) also had undefeated seasons but did not place among the top-10 programs in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central junior center Donovan Clingan averaged an impressive 36 points and 26 rebounds over one of the biggest weeks of basketball in Bristol Central program history.</p>
