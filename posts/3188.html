<p>BRISTOL - Defenders in scholastic soccer may not get all the headlines in the newspaper but Bristol Central senior Lily Hansen has been one of the team’s best players over the past few seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior captain has been a regular on the All-Conference team and is one of the CCC South’s top defenders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s going to be a collegiate future for the two-time captain come the fall of 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hansen, along with Maddie Ross and Christine Attle and keeper Maddy Corcoran have been the reason why Central’s early season ties didn’t turn into tough defeats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central opened play this year with a 1-1 stalemate at Avon on October 1 and drawing an even-steven 1-1 against rival Bristol Eastern two days later was impressive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hansen helped limit Southington to just two goals in a tough losing effort on October 6 but Central’s defensive core allowed Plainville and New Britain a combined one goal over the following two contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, Central is 3-5-2 but Hansen and crew have a great chance at helping the Rams finish the regular season at .500 before things are said and done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But she’s more than just an outstanding defender.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hansen can even cause a little havoc on offense when called upon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a sophomore, for instance, she tallied a goal and two assists for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But defense is her calling card and the senior - over the past two or three seasons - has been tasked in slowing down the elite offensive players of the CCC South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was on full display last year when Central battled Bristol Eastern in their first city series battle on Tuesday, October 8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hansen and the defense shutout the Lancers 1-0 as Bella Bosco netted the game-winning goal for Central from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with Faith Roy out due to injury, Hansen had to step up and take command of that backline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She did exactly that, leading the defense and helping her squad defeat Eastern in the shutoff effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my story about that city series soccer clash in the Bristol Observer last year, Central coach Ginny Godbout gave the defensive standout more than a little shoutout about her contribution to the victory over Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lily, all week, we’ve been talking about about how she has taken on that leadership role,” said Godbout of Hansen. “She hasn’t disappointed, that’s for sure.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that game, Eastern coach Scott Redman also gave Hansen and the defense credit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Central did a great job in limiting our really great chances,” said Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For her outstanding play last season, Hansen earned CCC South All-Conference honors and was rewarded with a little All-State recognition as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams went 8-5-3 in 2019 and had a very good campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Central has two players with the last name Hansen on its roster as freshman and sister Abby joined the squad - helping the team in the midfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abby scores goals, as she has against Lewis Mills and Plainville, while Lily stops opponents from scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bet there were more than a few backyard soccer battles in the Hansen family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More importantly, the senior also excels in the classroom at Bristol Central high school, earning Academic All-Conference honors the last couple years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all that hard work is getting Hansen to the next level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next year, Hansen is taking her talents to California University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s receiving an athletic scholarship to the NCAA Division II school and will represent the Mum City quite well at the collegiate level when she takes the field. </p>
