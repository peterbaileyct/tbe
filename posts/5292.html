<p>BRISTOL - There aren’t any breaks this season for the Bristol Eastern girls tennis team and on Friday, the Lancers welcomed a very talented Rocky Hill team to town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Terriers dominated, snaring a 6-1 victory from the Bristol Eastern high school tennis courts in a CCC Interdivisional tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Rocky Hill’s third straight match on the road and the squad ended the week with a surge in singles play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Terriers wrapped up a near shutout in singles action, sweeping the top for slots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the No. 1 singles match, Suhani Sheth defeated Ashlee Lewandoski by scores of 6-0 and 6-0 while at No. 2, Jen Kimball beat Brooke Treannie via the same scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Terriers Hannah Conneely (No. 3) turned away Ava Gesner by identical 6-0 scores and in the final singles’ position, Jasmine Ly defeated Trisha Mohan, a junior who got a chance to play in the final singles position for Eastern, by scores of 6-1 and 6-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the top spot of doubles play, the Lancers earned their only win of the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team of Jenna Cefaly and Brianna Kelley were challenged by Rocky Hill’s Palak Jain and Kira Ravat until the last ball was served.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Cefaly/Kelley combo ramped up the win by scores of 7-5 and 6-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rocky Hill was successful over the second two doubles challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team of Caitlyn Kownacki and Sophia Pawlak hung a 6-3 and 6-0 loss on Adrianna Reay and Olivia Dossias in the second doubles match and to wrap up the outing, the Terriers’ twosome of Katie Oostendrop and Alyssa Gau won against Eastern senior Gina D’Angelo and sophomore Taylor Berube in straight sets (6-0, 6-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, falling to 2-4 overall off the loss to Rocky Hill, have three matches next week - all commencing at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, Eastern travels to Southington to open the month of May and then on Thursday, it’s a trip to Wethersfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Friday, the Lancers open a two-match home stand, starting with a CCC Interdivisional clash against Newington.</p>
