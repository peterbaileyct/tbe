<p>Here at TBE, we look at all sides of sports - whether those events take place on a local scholastic front or even beyond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s always something fun happening in and around Bristol these days and here’s a quick adrenaline shot of what’s been going on over the last week or so:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Topic: Someone has a new haircut…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that someone is former Bristol Eastern scholastic basketball standout Elijah Parent who reported to the United States Coast Guard Academy on July 12 to begin his ‘collegiate training’ so to speak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant a little less hair to begin his stint in Newport, Rhode Island, and a whole bunch of ‘fun’ exercise - probably starting at the crack of dawn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll be at prep school for ten months for his training and move on to the Academy from there (I hope he can squeeze in a couple three-point shots along the way…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t be surprised, when everything is said and done, if Parent is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers if he chooses that route.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever he goes on to do, Parent is going to be an amazing representative of the city of Bristol during his time in the military.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That kid is talented, on and off the basketball court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Topic: So how did our favorite local skaters fare at the Shop Rite Nutmeg State Games on July 10?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d say the outfit of J, J &amp; G Sugrue (they’d make a pretty good law firm with that name) did extremely well this past Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant Jilleen, Jenny, and Carol all placed well over a crowded field of athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 117 Novice Ladies short program, Jilleen placed third in her event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 301 Novice Ladies FS, Jenny took third overall in both her short and long programs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Carol placed fourth in the 118 Junior Ladies short program while nabbing second over her long routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls represented Finer Edge Skating Club in Newington and did the program extremely proud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep Grandma smiling ladies…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Topic: Donovan Clingan commits to UCONN…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a huge moment for men’s collegiate basketball in our state when Donovan chose to stay home to attend UCONN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this needs to be said because over the years, too many scholastic players from Connecticut have come and gone as UCONN should have gone harder after the likes of big men Kuran Iverson and Marcus Camby over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give UCONN men’s basketball coach Dan Hurley a ton of credit because he had a plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that plan helped him land one of the good ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The competition was intense for Clingan's services, and I was worried because I thought Syracuse - who made Donovan his first offer - would be his school of choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, after one more year at Bristol Central, we’re all going to enjoy watching the center compete stateside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan is going to thrive in Storrs and our friends at D.P. Dough better be hooking up the 7-foot-2 center with unlimited calzones, wings, and breadsticks (I’m not joking about that).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Topic: Where are the Bristol Blues in the NECBL standings as of Tuesday?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues are battling but the franchise is still in last place in the overall standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Bristol chimes in at 6-19 and are ten games behind Southern Division leader Newport (16-9).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Northern Division, the Keene Swamp Bats are the top squad in the league at 17-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues are currently on a one game winning streak, defeating the Danbury Westerners by a 9-6 final on July 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol posted 13 hits to drop the Westerners to 11-11 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four players had multi-hit games for the locals as William Christopher Davis led the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third man in the batting order was 3-of-4 with a run scored and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Moore (5 IP, four hits, three ER, 8 Ks) won the game from the mound for Bristol while James Kirkpatrick (2 IP, no hits, 4 K) earned the save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s next game is on July 15 as the Blues welcome old friends - the Mystic Schooners - to Muzzy Field at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s always a great night out when the Blues are in town. Please go and support our local NECBL team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Small Ball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, here is a photo of Evan Bouchard of the Bristol Legion looking to bunt against Simsbury last Sunday.  Coach Jerry LaPenta is masterful at teaching his players the small things that often win ball games, especially in the era of composite bats and high scoring games. In a wood bat league, it’s the little things that make a difference.</p>
