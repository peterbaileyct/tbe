<p>If you ever spent a little time around Bristol Eastern senior Logan Meyer, you’d quickly realize that he is a highly energized individual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That might have been the first time he’s ever been described that way but the terminology is quite fitting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when going into battle – especially scholastically on the football field – the crafty do-it-all athlete wore a ton of hats for the Bristol Eastern program over the past few seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After watching him compete at Eastern, it was obvious Meyer could take his playing skills to the collegiate level and he recently made a critical decision about his future pigskin endeavors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A very deserving program will be bringing aboard a special player this fall and Husson University, a NCAA Division III institution in beautiful Bangor, Maine, ended up winning the lottery on that front.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Husson is going to get a hard-nosed, old school type of football player,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius of Meyer. “Logan has a really high football IQ with a tremendous motor at whatever position they want to play him at.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Julius thinks Meyer could fit Husson on either side of the ball and that kind of versatility makes him an athlete in high demand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s also very hungry and that’s something a prospective coach can see from a mile away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He constantly wanted to get better and improve his craft,” said Julius. “He just loves football. I couldn’t be happier that he’s going to play at Husson. The coaching staff up there really likes him too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Eastern, Meyer could play several positions and it wouldn’t be shocking, with his speed and versatility, if he ends up at a multitude of different positions once his collegiate career is said and done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meyer had a more than solid 2019 campaign for the Lancers, battling around injuries to cause a little havoc on the turf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can be plugged in at fullback on offense and linebacker on defense if needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meyer is over 6-feet tall and 220 pounds and will play to the whistle and maybe a little bit more after that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2019, he tallied a sack and was tied for second on the team in tackles-for-losses with four at Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He even made a couple kickoff returns for the Lancers that year but whatever position Meyer plays at Husson, he’ll be more than ready after missing the 2020 scholastic season at Eastern due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Husson did not play during the 2020 campaign but just missed going .500 the previous season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program was 4-6 overall and enjoyed victories over Becker, Curry, Nichols, and Salve Regina.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Husson is a member of the Commonwealth Coast Football (CCF) conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meyer and a few other players from the Eastern program expect to be playing football collegiately next season as the Lancers are churning out athletes that have the ability to compete at the next level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have good kids and they work hard,” said Julius of the Eastern program. “And their talents get recognized. It’s a credit to them. They work hard and they put good [film] out there. The most important thing is that all of all kids in our program, these are high character kids.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Both Meyer [and fellow senior Logan Schenck] are the highest level of character that we have in the program and I think that’s evident. Collegiate coaches pick up on that and that’s something they’re excited to get on their campus.”</p>
