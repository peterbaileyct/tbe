<p>BRISTOL – Battling into the final week of Connecticut Twilight Baseball postseason play, the third ranked Bristol Knights struck No. 2 Elmer’s Angels for two quick runs on Monday in a showdown to determine which team would go on to play for the league championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Elmer’s notched eight straight runs to seize the contest as Bristol was eliminated by an 8-3 final from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Angels (16-9) earned a shot at No. 1 Rocky Hill Rockies for the CTL championship in a best-of-three series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights ended their campaign at 14-11-2 overall and 3-2 in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing 2-0 against Bristol, Elmer’s added two runs in both the second and third innings and then put a four-spot on the scoreboard in the fourth to stretch the deficit to 8-2 through four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Mark Creamer lost a tough one on the mound, giving up four runs on eight hits over three-plus innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over the first inning-and-a-half of the game, it was all Knights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Plantamuro (3-for-4, run, RBI) led off with a single to right while Alejandro Soriano reached via a fielder’s choice to open play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Georgie Santiago drew a base-on-balls, two were on for the visitors with just the benefit of one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Veteran Earl Oakes eventually slapped a ball into left for a base hit as Santiago easily scored from second to give the Knights a quick 1-0 push.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plantamuro, manning his usual shortstop position, made a couple slick throws to first base in the bottom of the first as Elmer’s went down in order through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elmer’s pitcher Phil Ledwith (five hits, 5 Ks) struck out three straight before Creamer smashed a one-out flare to right as the ball just eluded the glove of Jonathan Wilson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creamer eventually stole third and with two gone, Plantamuro slipped a ball just inside the foul line in right field – plating Creamer – as Bristol doubled its lead at 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But from that point of the game, Ledwith was sharp and allowed just an infield hit to Plantamuro the rest of the way as Bristol’s offense went cold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elmer’s Mike Dean led off the second stanza with a monster rip to deep left as the home team had its leadoff batter on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just as Creamer look poised to get out of the jam, Taylor Kosakowski (three hits, four RBI) sent a loud two-out double to the gap in left – scoring Dean – as the deficit was chopped to 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nick Magoulas later reached on an error at first base and when Wilson dropped in a single to center, Kosakowski scored and quickly, it was all tied up at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out in the bottom of the third, Diogenes Espinal just snuck a two-base hit by Julio Ortiz-Rivera in center while making it third on a passed ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Dean went 2-for-2 as his Texas Leaguer just fell in behind shortstop to plate Espinal, propelling the Angles to a 3-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Maglio followed with a double deep to right to put men on second and this with one gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joel Avina bounced into a fielder’s choice as Dean was tagged out at the dish for the second out but with runners on second and third, Kosakowski jammed a base hit to the pocket at short to score Maglio – making it a 4-2 game through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creamer was plunked by a pitch with two gone in the top of the fourth but ended up stranded while Wilson started the flip side with a single to center as Elmer’s was about to put the contest to bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Joe Pereschino came in to throw for Creamer but hit Carter Marshall to open his stint on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A wild pitch put the runners in scoring position but Pereschino fanned Scott Kelleher for the first out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, a wild pitch scored Wilson to make it a 5-2 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Espinal and Maglio were both hit by pitches as the Angels had the bases juiced with two outs and Avina became the fourth batter nailed by a pitch in the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the HBP, Marshall quickly tagged the dish as the Angel’s edged up a 6-2 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howard Reuben then came into throw for the Knights with the bases still loaded up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Kosakowski sent a two-RBI single to left as the Angels wrangled up an 8-2 push as the fifth inning was upon Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plantamuro raced out an infield bunt to open the fifth and when Soriano walked, two were on for the Knights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Santiago stole second and as the ball slipped into centerfield, Plantamuro scored from third to trim the deficit to 8-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creamer drew a two-out walk in the sixth inning but nothing came of it as the Angles were in cruise control, still leading by five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the sixth for Elmer’s, Plantamuro made another one of his Derek Jeter defensive plays, chasing down a grounder by Avina and making a beautiful throw to first for the out as Bristol trailed 8-3 going into the final inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol was retired in order to close out the contest as Elmer’s moved to the CTL Finals via the 8-3 victory over the Knights.</p>
