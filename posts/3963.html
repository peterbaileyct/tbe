<p>Back in the day, January 9 was typically the date of the first showdown between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern boys basketball programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And forty-five years ago today, the Rams and Lancers took part in an epic, multiple overtime war.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city series bout involved close calls and even a fight between the squads but in the end, Central pulled out a huge 69-65 victory in three overtimes in the Rams’ gymnasium from the school on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win propelled Central to 8-1 overall and a perfect 5-0 in Colonial Conference tilts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters fell to 3-6 and evened its Colonial Conference ledger at 3-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams nearly went to the state tournament but at the end of the regular season, the Lancers needed to win their two final games to qualify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a one-point loss at Farmington (54-53) on February 17 dropped Eastern out of the playoff picture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central ended up going 14-7 overall, putting together a very good campaign under head coach, former UCONN Huskies standout Fred Malan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams had some scoring weapons to compliment the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry Tomasetti could put the ball in the hoop along with Willie Rosshirt and John Greenleaf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Todd Hasler was in the beginning stages of his 1,000-point career at Central while Dave Fortier sported a neat musketeer’s beard in the Rams’ team picture that year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contributors on that squad also included John Thomas, Jeff Thomas, and Scott Eschner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bruce Kuczenski, the former UCONN and professional player, was a freshman that season at Central while Joe DeFillippi - a future coach of the boys basketball program at BC - also earned varsity minutes as his career went along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern took the hardwood in 1975-76 under first year coach Jim Bates and his work ethic and emphasis on defense quickly helped turn around the Lancers program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 4-16 regular season under then coach Vin Punzo the previous season - which included a disastrous 105-45 loss to Southington on December 27, 1974, the worst loss in program history - Bates helped the BE team to a near .500 ledger that included a solid 8-6 record in Colonial Conference battles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rick Gleason was Eastern’s leading scorer that season at 13.2 points-per-game, Bob Fliss added 10.5 points while Marty Peabody averaged 10 points straight up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Grechko contributed nearly nine points an outing and Scott MacDonald and Gary Pearson notched over 5.0 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overtime was something the Lancers were very familiar with that season, especially when the game with Central came around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was one stretch of seven games in which the Lancers played overtime three times, with the Lancers going 1-2 during those contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first Central/Eastern showdown of 1976 came on that January 9 date and the squads needed several overtimes to finally determine the ultimate victor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greenleaf was the catalyst over the third extra frame as his six points made all the difference in the end against Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended the contest with 16 points as did Rosshirt while Tomasetti was the co-leading scorer in the game with 21 points.p</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fliss also canned 21 points, Gleason added 16 while Peabody nabbed 12 to lead the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central led the contest at the end of the first three periods of play, collecting leads of 11-10 and 34-28 at the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams scooped up a 46-44 edge through three completed quarters before the fun started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers tied it up at 56-56 to end regulation and then trailed by four (61-57) deep into the first overtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two Eastern baskets tied it up at 61-61 and after a late Eastern steal by Fliss, the visiting squad was looking for the win with one final hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Tomasetti drew an offensive foul and going into the second OT, it was still a 61-61 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads added just two points to the scoreboard and after six periods of action and the game was still tied - this time at 63-63.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central outscored Eastern 6-2 in the third and final OT frame as Greenleaf put the team on his back - notching all the points - as the Rams came away with a huge four-point victory over its crosstown rival.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern could not catch a break even after the epic loss against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers followed up the loss with a city series bout against St. Paul and overtime was needed once again to determine the winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 13, the Falcons foiled Eastern by a 47-44 final as Gleason tallied 12 points over the losing effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams qualified for the state tournament that year, falling in first round play to Bloomfield, 76-70.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers ended up one game short for playoff qualification (9-11).</p>
