<p>Every Wednesday in January was always a special day in the city of Bristol because it meant the scholastic wrestling squads were in action, hitting the mats and usually getting to the pay window in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic cancelled scholastic wrestling this season but that won’t stop The Bristol Edition from taking a quick look back to the year 2013.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight years ago, on Wednesday, January 23, Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern both picked up victories against CCC opponents that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Rams and Lancers won in complete romps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the focus is on Central as the program was going through an unusual rough patch that season after coming off a very good campaign the previous year (15-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, with the team hitting on all cylinders to end the year at the CIAC Class L Championships, the Rams were looking to score a big CCC Interdivisional victory against Edwin O. Smith High School of Storrs on that January 23 date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That night, everything clicked for the Rams – getting big pin-fall victories up and down the card while taking advantage of a few forfeit wins along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Central posted a 72-6 triumph over Smith from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central head coach Brian Archibald saw his troops pick up the win over the Panthers in just about every weight class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 106 pounds, Central’s Joe Cherwinski won via forfeit and Breck Conlon (113 pounds) pinned Smith’s Melissa Robichaux in just over 90 seconds of the first round (1:25).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Josh Ganavage (120) pinned Michael Ivan in 4:24 while Kadeem Richards (126) picked up win over Smith’s Elijah Maynard by a 7-2 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central Running back Tyler Borrow (132) did not have an opponent to face that night – earning six points for his squad – while at 138 pounds, Central’s Jordan Nadimi nabbed a close 4-3 decision against Smith’s Jacob Quirue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sean Ziogas (145) pinned the Panthers’ Graham Turner in 1:34 and Central’s Jordan Pelletier (152) earned a forfeit victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glenn Pierce (160) needed all but three seconds of the first round to pin Smith’s Nick Kyparidis and then at 170, Central’s Ian Gonzalez nearly followed suit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His win came via pin-fall in 1:51 against Smith’s Bradley Marston.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Gino Rafaniello (182) won on a forfeit, Cy McIntosh (195) pinned the Panthers’ Robert Clark in about 60 seconds while Cody McQuarrie (220) and Smith’s Jake Koehler bout almost went the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, McQuarrie was a pin-fall winner (5:53).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>E.O’s Matt Cobb grabbed the only victory for the visitors that day, pinning Central’s Troy Maldonado (1:37).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had a great finish that season at the Class L Championships over February 15-16, placing sixth overall with 118.5 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 132 pounds, Burrow won the state title as he tallied a huge 13-4 major decision victory over Farmington’s Garrett Hastings while Nadimi (138) earned a sixth place finish as did Pierce (160).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rafaniello (182) took home third place in a forfeit victory against Nery Ceron from Norwalk and finally at 195, McIntosh was the runner-up as Central finished the campaign with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Eastern won the CCC South title in 2013 behind a 6-0 record (16-3 overall) while Central finished 2-4 in the South and 6-9 overall…Eastern’s 60-19 win over Plainville that same January 23 evening established a new team record as the Lancers ended its meet against the Blue Devils with 10 pin-fall wins…According to the Connecticut Wrestling Online website, the 10 pins by Eastern was one off the city record, held by Central.The Rams had 11 victories via pin in a match from 1999 – a Mum City record.</p>
