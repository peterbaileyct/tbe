<p>BRISTOL - It was just a matter of time before the girls tennis program at Bristol Eastern was going to make a visit to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Friday, that trip finally took place as the Lancers mowed down Platt of Meriden by a 6-1 final in a CCC South confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first match victory for Eastern (1-2) while the Panthers are winless on the campaign (0-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt was able to secure the win in number one singles as Samantha Bergeron turned away Ashley Lewandoski by scores of 6-1 and 6-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the other six matches, Eastern was able to pull out wins with two of those encounters coming via forfeit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooke Treannie, Eastern’s No. 2 single’s competitor, defeated Jadelyn Chabla by scores of 6-0 and 6-2 to snare the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ Olivia Dossias tallied a 6-2 and 6-0 win over No. 3 Jamerie Rondini while Eastern’s Ava Gesner won via forfeit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in doubles play, it was all Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number one combination of Jenna Cefaly and Brianna Kelley nearly shutout Anna Gomez and Zaniyah Duncan by 6-1 and 6-0 scores and then in the No. 2 bout, it was more of the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s duo of Adrianna Reay and Trish Mohan defeated the twosome of Humyra Ferdus and Sarena Szymaszek with scores of 6-1 and 6-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers won the final doubles match by forfeit to complete the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is busy next week as the squad has three matches against CCC competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, the Lancers travel to East Catholic from Wickham Park while two days later, Eastern is on the road squaring off against Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Friday, the Lancers are back home in a battle against Rocky Hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
