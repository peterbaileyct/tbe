<p>GLASTONBURY – A good start by the Bristol Eastern baseball squad in Glastonbury turned ugly on Wednesday as the Tomahawks blasted the Lancers for 11 fifth inning runs – eventually roping up a 14-4 mercy ruled contest in a CCC Interdivisional tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game called in the bottom of the sixth, when Glastonbury went ahead by 10 runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 0-3 overall, while it was just Glastonbury’s first game of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers got solid pitching from Jaydon Churchill, chucking shut-out ball over his first four innings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed six hits, did not allow a free pass, and earned a strikeout but drew a no decision for his efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Glastonbury offense spurted early, Eastern’s did not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was scoreless until the third inning when Eastern’s Dylan Woodsome singled to lead off the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, three walks and a groundout scored both runs to make it a 2-0 contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fifth inning, the Kingstreeters held a 4-0 push thanks to two additional runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Martin opened the stanza with a single, followed by a walk, and then a run scoring double to center by Tyler Stickels and a sacrifice fly from Ryan Fradette plated the runs, as Eastern held a 4-0 cushion with Glastonbury down to its final nine outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fifth, Churchill retired the first Glastonbury batter and then gave up a long triple to right to Sam Benedict (4-for-4, triple, two runs scored).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill was relieved but soon after, the roof caved in for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tomahawks&nbsp;proceeded to send 13 batters to the plate off two Eastern relievers, taking advantage of seven hits, a walk, two hit batters, a wild pitch, and three Eastern errors to score eleven runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the miserable fifth inning finally concluded,&nbsp;Glastonbury was in the lead at 11-4.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern tried to jump right back in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern loaded the bases with one out in the sixth but could not score a run and Glastonbury ended the contest in the bottom of the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single, a walk, and then an error led to two runs, making it 13-4, and one final base-on-balls and a single drove in the final run for a 14-4 mercy rule ending for Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
