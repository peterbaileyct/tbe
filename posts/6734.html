<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Merchants of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League captured its first league title in 2004 as the franchise needed just three seasons to make a significant impact.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one year later, the Merchants were both champs of the regular and postseason in GHTBL play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a thirty-game slate in 2005, Bristol went 21-9 in regular season action, starting out at 2-3 before the locals sprinted to a 19-6 finish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol head coach Bunty Ray restocked the cupboard with some excellent talent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former Plainville high school standout Eric Butkiewicz made his Merchants’ debut, filling in for pitcher Scott Martin who hurt himself earlier in the season. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jerry Hasler, Chris Strahowski, Eric Baim, Brian Archibald, Adam Platt, and Kevin Browning all helped to make up a strong pitching unit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catching for that outstanding group was Matt Hackney and Joel Stamilio.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, 14-year veteran Adam Peters returned to the squad and defensively, the infield included a strong core of Rick Hewey, Lance Lamboley, Joe Parlante, Jay Ray, and the newest addition, GHTBL veteran Rick Barrett.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outfield included Ray, Cory Parker, Nick Mullins, and Chris Sawyer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Matt Arburr – fresh out of the Coastal Carolina League – eventually joined the team and added his stick to an already stacked line-up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GHTBL line-up in 2005 featured the East Hartford Jets, East Hartford Aeros, ProCare (Meriden), Avon Legion, Bill’s Sports Shop (Portland), People’s (Hartford), Mr. G’s, Vernon Orioles, Simsbury, Foss Insurance, and the Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol shared the regular season title with Foss Insurance and the league was extremely competitive from start to finish as Bristol was challenged every night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing 3-1 going into the bottom of the seventh against the Jets on June 1, Barrett kicked in a two-RBI single to tie the score and in the eighth, Stemilio’s hit to right plated Hewey to propel the Merchants to a season-opening 4-3 win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hasler gave up just one earned run before Archibald threw four innings of scoreless ball to earn the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on June 19, Bristol won its fifth straight game and were just 1.5 games behind Foss with 6-3 and 4-2 victories against Vernon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butkiewicz threw four shutout innings in game one to secure the win on the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mullins added three hits, including a two-run double, Hewey and Parlante dropped in three hits apiece while Platt collected three RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game two, Hasler threw a masterful one earned run gem that included five K’s over seven innings of work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray, Parlante, Mullins, and Hewey scored runs for Bristol for the sweep of the doubleheader.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants moved to 7-3 overall off the two wins.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on June 24 against the Aeros, Butkiewicz chucked a four hitter while Sawyer rambled up two hits and an RBI as Bristol won by a 3-1 final from McKenna Field in East Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol improved to 9-3 but was just getting started.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Foss on July 7, Peters smashed out a two-run homer while Hasler threw a four-hitter as Bristol picked up a huge 3-2 win from Muzzy Field – moving to 1-1 in the season-series against the Insurance racket.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an eleven-inning war at Simsbury on July 16, Parker singled home Parlante in the 11th as Bristol won by a 2-1 push to move to 14-5 overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five days later, Bristol swept a Bill’s Sports Shop (10-6) and Vernon Orioles (6-4) doubleheader that kept the Merchants in first place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stamilio cleared the bases via a blazing double against Bill’s to spur on a six-run fourth frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lamboley added three hits and two RBI while Parlante collected two RBI in the opening win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt and Butkiewicz took the hill against Bill’s, holding the fort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game two, Mullins doubled for two RBI and this time, it was a five run first inning that put the contest out of reach.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baim put together a three-hitter over six innings of work to earn his third victory in five days for Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>July 22 saw Strahowski (eight hits) out-duel Simsbury ace Tim Bourdon as the Merchants won, 1-0, and in the nightcap against Mr. G’s, Archibald drew the victory for Bristol as the squad scooped up a 9-1 victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parker and Ray ramped up two hits and three RBI apiece while Arburr had a big game in the winning effort – smashing out two hits as Bristol moved to 19-6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the year by beating Avon in two-of-three games as the Merchants finished the season at 21-9.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 28, Parlante drilled a three-run home run and Hewey was 2-for-4 with an RBI as the Merchants won at Avon, 8-3.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the regular season on July 31, Bristol fell to Avon (10-2) in the first game before belting the squad in the second (19-1).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parker jammed out a two-run homer in the losing effort for Bristol in game one while Hewey (7 IP) pitched the Merchants to victory in the night cap.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hackney picked up a grand slam, Parker added three hits,&nbsp;and Parlante also homered – belting a two-run shot – as Bristol scored a season-best 19 runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants earned the No. 1 seed in the playoffs as Foss and the Merchants tied for the league crown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the GHTBL tournament on August 3 (10-team, double elimination format from McKenna Field), Bristol defeated the Aeros, 9-3.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol zipped up 13 hits to take its tournament opener as Peters (two runs, RBI) and Parlante (two runs, three RBI) were both 3-of-4 from the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arburr also joined the 3-of-4 outfit, collecting three RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butkiewicz (5 IP, 1 ER, three hits) and Hasler (two hits) took care of business from the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top seed then defeated Simsbury on August 6, foiling the squad by a 12-5 final. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrett and Ray each had three hits while Strahowski threw a complete game as Bristol moved to 2-0 in tournament play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following day, Bristol defeated ProCare, 6-4, as Mullins kicked in a three-run double in the fifth to give the Merchants the lead for good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald threw three scoreless innings in relief to earn the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a surprise finish, ProCare ended up in the championship round but had to beat the Merchants twice to take the league title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That never came to pass as Bristol became repeat postseason champs – dropping ProCare 6-4 to take the GHTBL title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants stopped a late six-inning ProCare rally to hold on to win its second consecutive title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second inning in the finale, Arbor drilled a one-out single, Stamilio was then hit-by-pitch and Hackney followed with an RBI single – scoring Arburr.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ‘Bristol pickle’&nbsp;then allowed Stamilio to score from third base as Hackney was caught in a rundown between first and second, making it a 2-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third, Parker walked, went to second base on a wild pitch, and got to third safely as Ray reached by an error to put two on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Barrett sacrifice fly scored Parker and when Mullins reached second base off an error, Ray scored to make it a 4-0 contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butkiewicz was sharp over his first six innings, allowing one infield hit, no walks and five K’s.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Meriden loaded the bases in the seventh as the squad tallied three consecutive singles to put the game-tying run at the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sacrifice fly netted a run while Trey Bongiovanni generated the inning’s fifth single – scoring another run – to chop the deficit to 4-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald then came in for the final out to ice the championship for Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butkiewicz finished the campaign with a 4-1 record as Bristol ended up as back-to-back GHTBL champs.&nbsp;</p>
