<p>BRISTOL - After a spirited stalemate against undefeated Simsbury on Wednesday, the Bristol Eastern girls soccer team got right back to work at home versus Hall of West Hartford on Friday.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers allowed two quick goals and eventually suffered a 3-0 defeat from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>

<p>Hall improved to 5-2-4 off the winning effort while Eastern fell to 3-6-1 through 10 matches this year.</p>

<p>The visiting aggression notched two goals in a matter of three minutes to open play and never looked back.</p>

<p>Hall’s Nicky Deslauries scored 21 seconds into things, cleaning up a rebound off a shot from Talia Sortman and then moments later, Sortman crossed a ball that ended up finding the side netting after skirting by keeper Grace D’Amato (three saves) as Eastern trailed 2-0.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That score carried into the second half but when Hall’s Nicky Deslauries beat the Eastern defense, slotting in a shot to the far post during the 64th minute of play, the Lancers trailed 3-0 and never got into the fray offensively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hall outshot Eastern 8-5 while West Hartford keeper Allie Keith scooped in three saves to earn the win.</p>

<p>“Hall took the lead early and played a physical brand of soccer to control most of the play,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “Eastern had chances but couldn't find the back of the net.”</p>

<p>Next up, Eastern is home on Tuesday for a 6 p.m. contest against Middletown in a CCC South tilt from Alumni Field.&nbsp;</p>
