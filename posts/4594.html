<p>The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team is looking forward to a little home cooking over the next week or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And tonight, the Lancers battles Lewis Mills – a squad the locals romped twice last season in contests that were never close – in CCC Region B play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans defeated Avon last Saturday and comes to the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium with a little momentum on their side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Mills is going to have to battle an extremely motivated Lancers’ program as the team is looking for victory number four and a bit of revenge off a tough loss to Southington over the weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is what’s on tap for the Lancers against Lewis Mills:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (3-1) vs. Lewis Mills (1-3)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time –&nbsp;</strong>5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong>&nbsp;– Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium at Bristol Eastern</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The question – </strong>How angry is Eastern off its first loss of the season at Southington?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest against Mills opens a three-game home stand for the Lancers against teams that currently have a combined record of 4-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And who, out of all three of those teams have an equal to Eastern junior Ciara Collins?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s already scored 102 points this season (25.5 points-per-game) while averaging a team-high of 7.8 rebounds and is second on the squad in assists (4.5 per-game) behind Cali Doyon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins has not let up once this year and her blistering 51-percent shooting from the field proves she’s the first weapon Mills must stop on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern center Sage Scarritt is just off a double-double pace (8.0 points and 7.5 rebounds-per-game) and will be looking for a bit of a bounce-back against the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alyssa Kehler (11.8 points, 6.0 rebounds-per-game), Doyon (9.8 points, 5.0 assists-per-game, five three-pointers), and Taigan Parent (4.0 points, 3.0 rebounds-per-game) are all a big part of what Eastern has accomplished this year and make an extremely talented starting five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills is once again a young squad this year and trying to come into the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium – attempting to beat a determined Lancers’ squad – may not be in the cards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern needs to be wary of Abby Mills (that’s a familiar last name) and Brianna Pelchar who can heat up in a hurry for the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if Eastern’s transition game, trapping and pressing tactics that leads to turnovers and eventual lay-ups, makes any kind of appearance at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium, Mills is going to be in for a very long night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games on the horizon for Eastern:&nbsp;</strong>Eastern versus New Britain (Friday, February 26, 5:30 p.m.); Eastern versus Avon (Monday, March 1, 5:30 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>
