<p>Alas, we regret to announce that the TBE Tag Sale page died peacefully at home this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The offer of a free listing of any Tag Sales in town went unused for ten weeks. The Tag Sale became severely depressed because it considered itself a total failure, and the Sale eventually stopped breathing on its own. It was officially declared dead by its caretaker, Jack Krampitz, on Sunday, October 3, at 10:00 a.m..</p>

<p>The Tag Sale was surrounded by TBE editors when it passed. </p>

<p>Those of you who ignored the Tag Sale (You know who you are) can send cards and flowers to the Tag Sale Crematorium, 14 Nobody Cared Boulevard, Bristol, CT 06010.</p>
