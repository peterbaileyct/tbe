<p>EAST HARTFORD - After dropping a tough 2-1 decision to Bristol Eastern back on May 6, the softball squad from Bristol Central has been on a roll ever since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Monday evening, the Rams continued its torrid play - sinking East Hartford by a 23-8 final from McAuliffe Park in a CCC Interdivisional challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has won five straight games and pushed its season record to 11-3 with three games left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 23 runs scored by the Rams were a season high for the program as the contest was concluded in only six innings due to the 15-run mercy rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[We had] solid contributions from everyone today offensively,” said Central coach Monica Hayes via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all the big hitters got involved in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooke Soucy went 3-of-4 from the dish with two RBI, Janessa Bartell tallied three hits, two runs, and five RBI while Gwen Torreso ended up 3-of-5 with three runs scored and three RBI.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the regular season, Central battles at Plainville on Wednesday (6:30 p.m.), travels to red-hot Lewis Mills Friday (3:45 p.m.) and then on Monday, it’s a city-series encounter with Bristol Eastern (3:45 p.m.) from the softball field at BCHS.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>With its 11-3 overall ledger and .786 winning percentage, the program is currently in 11th place in the Class L playoff rankings…Tenth place Naugatuck is on fire as well, winning 10 straight in posting a 12-3 ledger. Currently, Masuk (16-0), St. Joseph (15-0), and Waterford (14-0) all boast undefeated records and are the top three squads in all of Class L.</p>
