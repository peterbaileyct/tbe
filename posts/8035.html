<p>While the first fundraiser for the Women &amp; Girls’ Fund was a very successful&nbsp;bake sale, an annual fundraising event appropriately titled the Wonder of Women (WOW) has been held since&nbsp;then.&nbsp;These fundraising efforts has resulted in an endowment of now valued at $830,000.</p>

<p>After having to cancel the 2020 event, the 2021 WOW was held on September 8 and welcomed approximately 350 people to the Aqua Turf to reflect and celebrate. The evening featured Patti Russo as the guest speaker, a nationally recognized leader focused on improving the quality of life for women in Connecticut and the United States; she currently serves as Executive Director of The Campaign School at Yale University.</p>

<p>Excerpts from the applications – which ranged from poems to mock press releases – were&nbsp;shared with the audience, and&nbsp;all grantees were in attendance to accept their grant awards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“One of the most powerful applications stated that ’it’s the year 2041, and in this year it’s our dream that we’re no longer here,’ suggesting that the challenges they help their clients overcome daily are no longer an issue,” said Cathy Cassin, Chair of the Fund’s Advisory Board. “Attendees at WOW were able to hear&nbsp;how their support of the event and the Fund is directly contributing to the ideas and solutions&nbsp;that&nbsp;organizations presented.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Women &amp; Girls’ Fund&nbsp;began with a living room meeting of local, dedicated women.&nbsp;It is thanks to their commitment and&nbsp;the commitment&nbsp;of hundreds of other supporters that the Fund is able to impact women and girls so broadly and so deeply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We will continue moving forward together,” stated Cathy Cassin. “As an endowed fund, the Women &amp; Girls’ Fund will be here forever.”</p>
