<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse squad finally got to play a match on its ‘new’ turf field on Saturday against Middletown in a CCC South tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been two years since the Lancers were able to compete on Alumni Field but the home team was unable to stop the visiting aggression - falling 20-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, the locals were fueled by the play of Ciara Collins as she netted two hat tricks worth of goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins tallied six goals overall while Emma Stavens kicked in three to pace the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 2-2 overall while the Blue Dragons raised their season ledger to 2-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The twenty goals Middletown collected was a season high for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury added two goals for Eastern, Caitlyn Ouellette&nbsp;was tough in the Lancers’ net while Lucy Winiarski&nbsp;and Jayna Hatcher also played well in the back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have a two-match week coming up, starting with a city series entanglement against St. Paul Catholic from Alumni Field on Monday at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the following day, Eastern travels to Cottone Field on the campus of Wethersfield high school for a showdown against the Eagles at 5 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A scheduled encounter against Bristol Central on Friday has been postponed and will be moved to another date.</p>
