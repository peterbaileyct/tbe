<p>The pairings are now set in stone for the girls Central Connecticut Conference Girls Basketball Tournament and the two public schools in Bristol will be in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams that earned a chance to compete in the top tier will battle for the CCC Tournament title and Bristol Eastern is one of those top eight seeds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers (10-2) nabbed the eighth and final seed in the championship bracket and squares off against No. 1 Newington in a can’t miss opening round showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 5:30 p.m. Monday night from Newington High School as all home games in the postseason are scheduled to be played at the higher seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern needed a little luck to get that seed due to a low lot draw which was used as a tie-breaking device by the CCC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams were seeded by winning percentage, then head-to-head play and finally by lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six teams with 10-2 records were in the rankings this year and the Lancers were one of those programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, Eastern was tied with Southington (10-2), Plainville (9-3), and Farmington (8-4) in the standings and the Lancers needed some help to get in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Help meant other teams beating Plainville and Farmington because each program had a better lot number than Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If all those squads ended up tied with the Lancers when tournament time was about to commence, the Kingstreeters would have been a featured team in the second bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was 7-2, along with Plainville, Farmington, and Southington at one point, with three games left to play in the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers won out, as did Southington – who bounced Plainville (57-43) and Farmington (47-38) – to earn championship round seeds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant Plainville and Farmington were going to be forced into the second bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, along with Eastern, the championship tier is completely stacked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor (11-1) is the number two seed in the tournament while Simsbury (11-1) is third due to head-to-head play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington (10-2) earned the fourth seed and drew the highest position of the remaining 10-2 programs due to lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 5 East Hartford, No. 6 Middletown, and No. 7 Edwin O. Smith round out the top bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Eastern can get past Newington, the Lancers would be on the road at the winner of Southington/East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central earned the No. 27 seed overall (No. 3 in the fourth bracket) and that meant a home seed on Tuesday night against No. 30 Bulkeley (No. 6 in tier 4, 0-11 overall).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (2-10) earned the third seed in the final bracket due to its two wins over Lewis Mills this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each team is guaranteed two games in postseason play while the winner and runner up in each bracket will play three times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The finals of the other three brackets will not be playing for a title. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
