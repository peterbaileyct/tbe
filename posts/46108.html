<p>Today on behalf of the American Legion, Post 2, Mrs. Caminiti, wife of Joe Caminiti was given a Quilt. Her being unable to be there due to her recovering from a fall, was given to her husband Joe Caminiti.</p>

<p>Was hoping to present it to her on June 9th when the ELK Lodge plans to Honnor Joe Caminiti. Due to her fall, it looks like she will not be able to attend on the 9th. Thus, it was presented earlier.</p>
