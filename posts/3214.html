<p>Voting at Mountain View School was steady around 11:40 a.m., with the wait time between 10 and 15 minutes, according to TBE contributing editor Rit Carter.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Forty minutes ago," Carter texted, "the wait was a half hour."</p>

<p>Polling places at Edgewood and Northeast are relatively quiet, he said, with lines that remain in the building. At Bristol Eastern, he texted, there are about 15 to 20 cars in the parking lot.</p>

<p>By 1 p.m., unofficially, 12,173 of Bristol's 37,169 eligible voters, 32.7 percent, have cast their votes in-person, according to figures provided by Democratic Deputy Registrar Tracy Beland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At noon, 9,838 absentee ballots of the 10,585 requested, 93 percent, have been returned, Beland wrote in a text. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There are a possible 757 to be cast till 8 tonight," she added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The counting of absentee ballots began at 10:30 a.m., she texted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, unofficially, combining the returned absentee ballots with those cast in-person, making 22,011 total, means almost 60 percent of eligible voters had voted by 1 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prospective voters can still register at city hall if they have moved from another town or state or never voted, Beland texted. They will need a valid photo ID and proof of residency, including a bank statement or utility bill but not including an Amazon receipt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Absentee ballots will be accepted until 8 p.m. tonight, she texted, and will be counted Wednesday. </p>
