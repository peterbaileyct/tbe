<p>BRISTOL - Bristol American Legion Baseball standout Tyler Martin did a little of everything for the program this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a utility player Bristol head coach Jerry LaPenta could turn to in a pinch and excelled in both a starting or reserve role.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin could hit the best pitchers in Zone 1 while his glove in the Bristol infield helped to steady the defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, not surprisingly, the Bristol Eastern graduate was rewarded at the end of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin and West Haven’s Tyler Jones were awarded the 2021 Connecticut American Legion Baseball Scholarships this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both players earned $1,000 scholarships for their efforts over the summer while Martin also received a $500 American Legion National award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin helped the Bristol program go 19-7 overall this season as Post 2 won the Zone 1 championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin played wherever LaPenta needed to him to and that meant second&nbsp; base one night or third the next.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin had a big sacrifice bunt in Bristol’s first win over South Windsor (7-1) on June 11 while going 2-for-3 at the plate in Post 2’s 3-1 victory over Avon on June 30.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Bristol’s tough 9-4 loss over Meriden on July 1, Martin went 1-for-2 with a sacrifice fly and two RBI - playing at second base - while manning third in Post 2’s showdown against Naugatuck the following evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin walked twice in Bristol’s 14-7 thumping of Naugatuck back on July 23 and posted another two hits in a close loss at Avon on July 26.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin was a dependable hand for the Bristol American Legion Baseball program in 2021 and was an excellent representative of the team.</p>
