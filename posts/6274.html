<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;If you give multiple chances to Bristol American Legion baseball slugger Ryan Fradette, he’s eventually going to burn you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol Eastern standout has a very good eye at the plate and bats anywhere from clean-up to the sixth position in the Post 2 batting order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against West Hartford this past Sunday, Fradette was slotted fourth in the line-up and caused absolute havoc in the seventh inning to help steal away the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started the afternoon 0-for-1 with a walk but in the bottom of the sixth, after Adam Caron and Andrew Lozier drew consecutive walks, a wild pitch advanced the duo and Fradette cranked a ball into the outfield off a 2-2 count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the West Hartford left fielder played so far in, he was a quick hop, skip, and a jump away from the dirt at shortstop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He snared the ball out of the air for the first out of the inning as Fradette was robbed of a hit and the next two batters did not produce a game-winning tally either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with two on again in the seventh, in a 3-2 game, history would not repeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette bounced a ball away from the third baseman as it bounced into left field – scoring the tying and game-winning runs – as Bristol snared a huge 4-3 victory from Muzzy Field in a must-win game. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He had a great at-bat, a line drive” which was caught said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Fradette’s poke in the sixth inning. “This one [in the seventh] wasn’t a great hit but he hit it hard with a tilt-topspin. It was huge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Alex Canzellarini was a right time/right place winning pitcher of record on Sunday – needing just five pitches to get Bristol out of a sixth stanza jam, earning the victory in the process against Post 96.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit also belonged to Roberto Cruz as he struck out three over a 13-pitch stint in the top of the seventh in 0.2 innings of relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both pitchers are eligible to throw as of today while Lorenzetti will be next available to pitch on July 2 due to pitch count rules. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol’s roster is (nearly) set</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last couple weeks, Bristol has been trying to nail down its roster and recently, the senior team added Bristol Eastern’s Jaydon Churchill into the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill is another varsity performer that LaPenta could use on the mound while he supplies deep level insurance at second base or in center field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had his moments in an Eastern uniform over the spring and in a pinch, Churchill can chuck an inning or two for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depth is something Bristol has in spades and not every Zone 1 team has the kind of quality depth Post 2 enjoys every summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Zone 1 Standings – As of Monday, June 28</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of Monday afternoon, the Zone 1 standings are a bit of a jumble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 4-1, Avon is now the Zone 1 leader after Bristol picked off West Hartford (6-2 overall) the previous day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After starting the season at 1-2, Meriden is in third place and has won two straight games in zone play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck is also tied for third, hanging in at 3-2 and are 1.5 games behind first place Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol is also in the hunt at 4-3, just percentage points behind Meriden and Naugy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, one of Bristol’s goals this season is to qualify for the Regional Tournament – representing the top two teams of all five zones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If you want to go to the Regional Tournament, you have to be in the top two” spots of the zone said LaPenta. “If we don’t [win against West Hartford], we’re probably three games back for the second spot and it would be a tough uphill battle.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The strange part of Zone 1 this season is observing the struggles of Berlin and Simsbury – two squads that have been successful over the summer months throughout the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury (0-4) and Berlin (0-5) are a combined 0-for-9 in Zone 1 play, scoring a combined 10 runs overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol is the hot team right now</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Bristol has won three straight zone games – four of five overall – as Post 2 is the hottest team in Zone 1 for the time being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, Bristol goes to Berlin on Tuesday (Sage Park, 6:30 p.m.), and then plays three straight Zone 1 games from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon is in town Wednesday (5:45 p.m.), Meriden travels to Bristol on Thursday (5:45 p.m.) and after a day off, Berlin makes its first Mum City appearance of the campaign on Saturday at 1 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We put ourselves in a good spot,” said LaPenta. “Now, we’ve got three games on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. So, we’ll see what happens.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>…Originally, Saturday was supposed to be a doubleheader but the non-zone feature against Fairfield has been cancelled…Bristol’s schedule after the fourth of July sees the program travel to Naugatuck on Tuesday, July 6 and then is home for a Zone 1 confrontation against Newington on Thursday, July 8 at 7 p.m.</p>
