<p>It would be shameless not to recognize Bristol Eastern’s newest All-State runner, junior Fiona Gallagher - an exceptional athlete who was one of the top harriers in the Mum City this year along with two seniors, Bristol Central’s Natalia Popielarz and Eastern teammate Avery Braccia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gallagher became just the second female runner from Bristol Eastern to earn All-State honors, along with Amanda Sumner (Class of 2008, The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both of those athletes made races from Stanley Park in New Britain their showcase events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On October 16, 2008, the CCC South Championship race from Stanley Park saw Sumner win the event in 19:05, which nearly established a Bristol Eastern record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sumner holds the Lancers’ fastest time of 18:56, clocked at the Greater Hartford Invite on October 4, 2008.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Gallagher was exceptional as well, posting a time of 20:10 - her personal record - from Stanley Quarter Park on October 28 against New Britain as she was the leading runner on the Eastern squad this past fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gallagher won her race against the Golden Hurricanes and will have one more opportunity to improve her outstanding times in 2021 as a senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last two months, Gallagher and the Lancers’ squad were a very competitive bunch during what turned into a weird and shortened season that ended up not having its usual class races and State Open events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To go along with that outstanding time of 20:10, Gallagher won the race at Lewis Mills back on October 21 - making a finish of 21:09, while at the final regular season meet for the Lancers on November 4, Gallagher nearly netted another career best time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a close loss to Avon on November 4, she was the runner-up from the Fisher Meadow Soccer Fields in Avon - posting a time of 20:12.6 to end the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in her final Bristol Eastern meet of the campaign, Gallagher placed sixth in the Central Connecticut Conference Region B Championships on November 10 with a finish of 20:52 from Stanley Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her improvement from October 1 to the end of the season was impressive as she finished her final three races in under 21 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After placing fourth in the Lancers’ opening day meet against Farmington on October 1, Gallagher either finished in first or second place the remainder of the scholastic season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gallagher proved she belonged with the best runners of the Central Connecticut Conference as a sophomore, making a top-30 showing in the Class MM championships in 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She placed 28th overall with a time of 21:58 from the course at Wickham Park in Manchester on Saturday, October 26.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as freshman, Gallagher placed 51st at the 2018 Class MM Championships in 22:27 - another very good finish from Manchester.</p>
