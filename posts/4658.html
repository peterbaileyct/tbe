<p>“We swam hard and achieved 25 season best times today at Cornerstone” in Avon said Bristol coach Adrienne Bentley.</p>

<p>And first place finishers were found all over the board for the Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern/St. Paul Catholic squad.</p>

<p>Davis Kroll won the 200 free and 100 free event while&nbsp;teammate Gabriel Bartolome (200 IM and 100 back) was a duel victor as well.&nbsp;</p>
