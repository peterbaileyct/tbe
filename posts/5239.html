<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central softball squad continues its torrid start to the 2021 campaign and in a CCC South confrontation, the program from Plainville was simply blitzed by the Rams on Monday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the end, Central etched up a huge 16-1 victory from the BC softball field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are now 4-1 overall and have won two straight games since falling at Southington (9-6) on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But against the Blue Devils (0-2), the locals needed just five innings to seal the deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the hill for Central, Alex Sciarretto dominated as she zipped up 13 strikeouts in the 15-run, mercy-ruled victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And guess who had another home run? The answer is Gwen Torreso, as the senior has made those kind of hits a staple of her offensive arsenal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She belted a round-tripper while teammate Janessa Bartell added three RBI to the till.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso had a two RBI day to help complement her sisterâ€™s offensive effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, Sam Sklenka, Kaley Laird, and Sciarretto all tallied two hits apiece to help the program get halfway to state tournament qualification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next up for the Rams is a huge CCC South tilt against Berlin (6-1) on Wednesday from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since losing to Rocky Hill last Friday by an 11-6 push, the Redcoats have won two straight which includes a 13-7 pounding of Platt on Monday in Meriden.</p>
