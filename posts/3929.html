<p>On January 7, the CIAC Board of Control held a morning meeting to discuss the up-coming metrics that would help shape each scholastic sport during the upcoming winter campaign as the nation still grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every sport outside of wrestling is still on the table with practices for boys and girls basketball, boys and girls indoor track, and boys swimming — programs that are eager to hit courts, tracks and pools in Bristol - are slated for a January 19 start date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wrestling, along with competitive cheer and dance, are considered high risk’ sports and will not commence with the rest of the winter athletics programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Factors that will guide the winter campaign include input from the Connecticut Department of Public Health and the Governor’s Office that will require COVID protective elements athletes must abide by — on and off the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In-person learning, which differs around the state, will also be taken into account.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Winter Sports plan will take some definite shape at next week’s meeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With approval by the board this morning, the initial COVID mitigating strategies for winter sports will be shared with our member schools in the coming days,” according to the CIAC website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be some different elements for each winter programs such as players wearing masks on the basketball courts during games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several other safety guidelines and precautions for each sport will also be revealed in the near future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another concern is having students back on campus and school grounds for practices, scrimmages, and games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remote learning could keep certain school buildings closed and the possibility of a winter sports season in doubt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several factors will help shape how things play out come January 19 but there is high confidence that the winter scholastic campaign gets a green light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, the CIAC board of control will meet up with the Governor Ned Lamont’s Office and the Department of Health to review guidelines and make any updates needed for the winter sports campaign to commence on time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will have more information on the winter sports campaign when a final plan comes to fruition.</p>
