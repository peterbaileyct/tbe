Upon graduation from high school in 1951, she held various clerical jobs and retired from The Hartford Insurance Company. After meeting the love of her life, Raymond, she dedicated most of her life to raising their seven children. She spoke French fluently all her life after growing up in a French household. She was a parishioner of St. Matthew Church in Forestville. Doris and Raymond enjoyed many years of vacations at Cape Cod, square dancing, and riding on their Honda Gold Wing. They also enjoyed traveling in their RV with their children and later in life with their grandchildren. </p>
