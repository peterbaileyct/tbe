<p>NEWINGTON - By the completion of Bristol Central’s baseball game against Newington on Tuesday afternoon, one of the squads would have punched its postseason ticket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that team was Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A three-run third inning was all the Rams needed to topple the Nor’Easters as Central rolled Newington by a 6-2 final from Alumni Field in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central (8-5) has now won four out of its past five contests and is clearly rolling, though the program was missing a couple components against the Nor’Easters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn’t matter as Matt Beaucar threw a five-inning gem and when he got into trouble, Frank Spirito took over – nabbing the save in relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar allowed just two runs, walking one while fanning four to seize the victory for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito threw two scoreless frames, saving the game for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, that same duo led the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito went 3-for-4 with a double and three RBI while Beaucar was 2-of-3 with two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jacoby Banks added a double to the hit patrol as Central out-hit Newington, 8-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robert Alex Cappellucci and Nick DiCioccio each doubled for the Nor’Easters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gavin Gray drew the loss as those three third inning runs loomed big on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington chopped the deficit to 3-2 through five innings and with the contest on the line late, Spirito shut down the Newington offense while Central notched three runs in the top of the seventh to ice the event – wrapping up the four-run victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington fell to 7-4 overall off the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are back in action on Wednesday in a CCC South tilt at Middletown from Palmer Field at 3:45 p.m.</p>
