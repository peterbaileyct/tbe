<p>How about some good news for a change?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After being inundated with chaos in Washington, a horrific pandemic, and just plain old stress that’s not good for anyone, the Bristol Tramps are spreading a little ray of sunshine over the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, January 13, the Tramps announced their scholarship recipients for 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each one of these student-athletes have excelled in the classroom, on the field and in the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As always, the Tramps have recognized individuals from all three of the high schools in town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, the Julie Larese/Frank and Antoinette Scalia Scholarship was awarded to Natalia Popielarz from Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern’s Avery Braccia earned the Julie Larese/Patricia D'Amato Memorial Scholarship award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Julie Larese/John E. Tavera Family Memorial Scholarship was awarded to St. Paul Catholic’s Nina Zwolinski.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They are all very accomplished and outstanding young women,” said long time Bristol Tramps committee member Donna Papazian of the trio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Popielarz, the daughter of Justyna and Mark Popielarz, just put together an excellent season for the cross country team at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the CCC Region B Championship from Stanley Quarter Park in New Britain, Popielarz ran a great race, taking third place overall in a time of 19:30 at the 5K showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the process of that outstanding finish, Popielarz took home All-State honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She won Central’s meet against New Britain in 19:39 on October 21 while Popielarz started the fall season against Avon, crossing the finish line in 21:42 for first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Braccia, the daughter of Melinda and Rich Braccia, also excelled on the cross country courses this past fall - giving the girls program at Eastern an impressive 1-2 punch along with teammate Fiona Gallagher.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s been one of the featured runners for the Lancers over the past few seasons, ending her career at the Region B Championship in 15th place with a finish of 21:55.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Zwolinski, the daughter of Jadz and Robert Zwolinski, was the outstanding keeper for the St. Paul Catholic girls soccer program over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was an All-State selection in 2017 and 2019 and will attend American University - playing for the women’s soccer team this coming fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All scholarships are $1,000 awards.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each and every year, the Bristol Tramps honors Bristol’s rich sports history and this year’s celebration is slated for September 10.</p>
