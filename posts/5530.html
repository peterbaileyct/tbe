<p>Here’s a quick catch-up on the Bristol Eastern girls tennis team who managed to break a five-match losing streak this past Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On May 12, the Bristol Eastern girls tennis team had its collective hands full against Lewis Mills in a CCC South tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And by the completion of the match, the Lancers earned a well-deserved trip to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern defeated the Spartans by a 4-3 final - taking two decisions each in both singles and doubles play from the Lewis Mills tennis courts in Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s No. 2 singles player at that match, Brooke Treannie, ended up beating Ava Joiner by scores of 6-3 and 6-4 and at No. 4, the Lancers&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ava Gesner defeated Lilah Moley by set scores of 6-2 and 6-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in doubles action, Eastern’s No. 2 and No. 3 teams were victorious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The No. 2 combination of Trisha Mahan and Adrianna Reay needed three sets to turn away the Spartans team of Summer Abdelrehim and Samantha Nestor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern tandem lost the first set by a 1-6 score but came away with a 6-3 victory in the second tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, in the third set, the Lancers wrapped up a 10-7 win to take the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, the No. 3 Eastern doubles combination of Gina D’Angelo and Taylor Berube won via forfeit to help their squad take the win in the end - moving to 3-9 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lewis Mills dropped to 2-6 off the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the following day, Eastern fell to Tolland, 5-2, from the tennis courts at Bristol Eastern in a CCC Interdivisional match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both of Eastern’s No. 2 teams were victorious against the Eagles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Briana Kelly defeated Robyn Avery over set scores of 7-5 and 6-2 and then in doubles play, Olivia Dossias and Reay dropped the team of Alli Engle and Taylor Grant, 6-3 and 6-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three matches on the Lancers’ docket this week, each with a start time of 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern battles Plainville on Monday in Bristol, then the Lancers travel to Berlin on Wednesday for another CCC South confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Friday, it’s a city series entanglement as Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern battle it out from the tennis courts at BE.</p>
