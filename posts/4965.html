<p>AVON - With less than three minutes to play in the final game of the CCC girls basketball tournament, fourth bracket, the crew from Bristol Central was leading 29-27 and had top-ranked Avon on the ropes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams did not score a point over the final 3:34 of the game, Avon’s Katelyn Wankier scored the game-tying hoop and when teammate Sophie Mango drained the go-ahead free throw with 1:43 to play, third ranked Central was unable to respond as the Falcons scooped up a 33-29 victory on Friday to take the bracket finale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (4-11) came rolling into the final game - having defeated Bulkeley (70-19) and second ranked Northwest Catholic (52-42) to earn a shot at Avon via a three-game winning streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t going to be easy on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons (5-9) led by a 7-0 push early, trailed by as many as five late before making all the big plays to end the fourth quarter, earning the victory in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jocee Powers (game-high 14 points) opened the contest with seven straight points over the first two minutes - leaving Central to play catch-up for the remainder of the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Bartell (10 points) hit 5-of-6 free throws while Brooke Watson splashed in a 3 over first quarter play and through eight minutes of action, Avon’s edge was chopped to 12-8 via Central’s 12-5 run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams’ defense was excellent over second quarter play, limiting Avon to just two points in the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Falcons didn’t score a point over the final 5:47 of the second frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s when Central nabbed the lead at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finishing the second quarter on an 8-0 jaunt, Ella Watson and Sophia Torreso drained back-to-back 3s to tie the score and when Brooke Watson flipped in a lay-up at the halftime buzzer, the Rams held its first lead of the afternoon at 16-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams briefly exchanged the lead in the third tilt but late in the quarter, Bartell found Sophia Torreso for a three and when Bartell sank a foul line bank shot, Central entered the final frame in front by a 22-18 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth, two free throws by Mango tied the score at 24-24 with 6:25 to go but Central had a couple answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Steve Gaudet slowed things down and when Bartell sent a pass over to Sophia Torreso for another wide open 3, the Rams led it by three, 27-24.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two minutes later, Gwen Torreso found Bartell for a lay-up and with 3:34 left in regulation, Central’s lead of 29-24 was the largest of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Avon retook the lead with 1:43 to play, Bartell missed a hoop but Avon turned the ball over with a ton of time left on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With under a minute remaining, Ella Watson missed a runner but off a jump-ball, Central got it back - still trailing 31-29 - with 48.5 seconds to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central held the ball, took timeout with 17.3 seconds left, and looked for one last hoop to tie or go ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a turnover with eight seconds to play led to an Erin Geary lay-up at the buzzer as Avon won the contest, 33-29.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The game marked the final contest for Central seniors Janessa Bartell, Damani Hough, and Gwen Torreso.</p>
