<p>In the same way that the fall scholastic season began this year, the CIAC will postpone the start of its winter sports campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practice was scheduled to begin on November 21, but the CIAC has pushed back that date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The regular season was to commence on December 7 with a reduced schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Department of Health has not released guidelines that the 2020-21 activities will have to follow, but a decision by the DPH should be made known relatively soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An email was sent earlier today by Glenn Lungarini, the CIAC’s executive director, explaining the delay and what to expect.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The CIAC anticipates an update by DPH on winter sports very soon,” said Lungarini in the email. “A meeting with the CSMS Sports Medicine Committee is scheduled for next week to review updated DPH sport guidance along with the CIAC winter sports draft plan. Upon completion of that meeting, the CIAC will have a final winter sports draft proposal for consideration by the CIAC Board of Control.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To allow adequate time to review updated DPH guidance and to receive recommendations from CIAC’s Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, the CIAC Board of Control meeting has been rescheduled to Tuesday, November 17th. The CIAC understands that, upon approval of its winter sports plan, each member school will need some time to review that document with its local health department. Therefore, the CIAC is postponing the November 21st winter sports start date. The CIAC Board of Control will consider a new start date for winter sports at its November 17th board meeting.”</p>

<p>What is also unknown is the fate of the winter postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some New England states have already cancelled their own state tournaments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just last week, the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association cancelled its 2020-21 scholastic postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is unknown, due to lingering effects of COVID-19, if Connecticut will follow suit.</p>
