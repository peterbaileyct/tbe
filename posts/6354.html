<p>Come Sunday Morning, the potato salad and pasta salad Mary and I will be taking to the family Fourth of July picnic will have been whipped up and ready to go. In addition, there will be the folding table and some other odds and ends, some requested like the table, others we will bring with us, gifts so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Among the&nbsp;later&nbsp;is&nbsp;a camping stove that has been gathering dust in one of the&nbsp;kids&nbsp;bedrooms and a hardwood wheeled dolly that can carry 1,000 pounds. The dolly,&nbsp;I am hoping, will help make the transfer of an enormous window air conditioner a little easier when the air conditioner&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be stored for winter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>FYI: The dolly was around $10 at Harbor Freight, which, of course, is located on Farmington Ave. in the building that had housed Staples. For someone who is not at all handy, that’s me, it’s a fun place to roam around for a while to see all the things that make those house projects easier. Typically, I am a City True Value guy, but when grandpa’s drill began coming apart—specifically, the cord separated from the plug—the trip was necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Fourth picnic originally set on Saturday was rescheduled after a few glances at the weather app.&nbsp;So&nbsp;Sunday it is.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>There is always something going on in the week, and this one was no different. The one thing I would like to dwell on for a few minutes here happened way back on Monday, when Gov. Lamont showed up to announce that Bristol had received a $2 million grant to clean up the Sessions building on Riverside Ave. I wrote about the grant when it was announced the week before. (Click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/2-million-grant-from-the-state-to-assist-with-sessions-building-clean-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;to read the story.)&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a big deal—a lot of money for what promises to be a&nbsp;pretty nice&nbsp;development—91 market-priced apartments 43 or so of them in the Session building and the rest in a building to be constructed on the property later. Officials speechified, which can be tedious to sit or stand through, but this time around, if one listened, the chatter really did have a lot to it about the funds and what they will be doing to&nbsp;help out&nbsp;a bunch of communities across the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s good to see that the governor and lt. governor decided to make the announcement here in Bristol. It says something about how things are turning around, and it sheds some light on how that happens. A good relationship with Hartford helps, and Lt. Gov. Susan&nbsp;Bysiewicz&nbsp;alluded to how Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu&nbsp;is not shy about knocking on the door there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was no surprise, either, that Gov. Lamont, rather than rushing off to his next appointment, shuffled off to Memorial Boulevard for an update on the rebuilding of the wall that collapsed along the&nbsp;Pequabuck&nbsp;River, taking&nbsp;out a large section of sidewalk, and for a firsthand look at the work being done on the Memorial Boulevard&nbsp;Intradistrict&nbsp;Arts Magnet School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I kind of just hung around to get some photos, at the periphery, while Public Words director Ray Rogozinski, Deputy state Director of Economic and Community Development Alexandra Daum, State Rep. Christopher Ziogas, Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu&nbsp;and Gov. Lamont chatted among themselves and took in the environs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Here is a video clip from Lamont’s speech and a bunch of photos:&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is better is that Bristol has not been idle. This grant comes at a critical moment, since earlier in the month at its meeting Public Works had been considering some key renderings for upgrades to Riverside Ave. (and Park St.).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;It’s all good. And it just did not happen from sheer luck but from some good leg work, lots of planning, and efforts of not a few people, among them a few elected officials, namely, the&nbsp;mayor, a&nbsp;solid core of city employees who wrote grants, met (and meet) regularly to problem solve, and the people who volunteer for and people our commissions and boards.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is the kind of work we celebrate on the Fourth of July—people who get it: that our system of government on each level, city, state, region, nation,&nbsp;requires us to roll up our sleeves and work together, not only for what “I” can get but for what “we” can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a tug between self-interest and the greater good, so there&nbsp;is going to be give and take, conflict, compromise. In other words, there is no “I” without something bigger to foster “I’s.” Conversely, without “I’s” pulling together there can for the greater, we might not have "I's." Okay, I have to work on that a bit.</p>

<p>Enough preaching!&nbsp;</p>
