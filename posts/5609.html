<p>BRISTOL – It was a memorable day on the field for Bristol Eastern softball pitcher Ali Tellier Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier ended up throwing a no-hitter against St. Paul Catholic as the Lancers rolled up a 16-0 win on the road in a non-conference affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was called after five innings via the mercy rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The no-no came a day after Tellier allowed Lewis Mills just three hits as she moved to 10-4 overall off the winning effort against the Falcons (4-15).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Tellier went 2-for-3 from the dish and then in the circle, she collected eight strikeouts as she faced just two batters over the minimum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She allowed just two walks as St. Paul Catholic baserunners were few-and-far between.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (11-5) belted the home squad for 15 hits as several players had multi-hit games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Kingstreeters, Jasmine Perez went 3-for-3 with three RBI and Janessa Gonzalez was 2-for-3 with a home run and three RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Policki went 2-of-4 with two RBI, Alex Shorette added two hits and three RBI, and Ashley Serafin got into the mix with two hits, three runs scored, and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace D’Amato slammed out a double and scored twice while Riley Giblin and Jazmyn Browne each tallied a run for the visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul Catholic’s Meg Gaudreau and Julia Lawson each drew base-on-balls for the home team but did not score in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a scoreless first inning of play, Eastern went for eight runs in the top of the second with Serafin and Tellier blasting out RBI doubles and Perez collecting a two RBI single to lead the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, Perez jammed out an RBI single as Gonzalez blasted her home run and after the four-pack of runs, Eastern was in front by a 12-0 push through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in the fourth frame, the Lancers padded its lead with four additional runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RBI hits by Gonzalez, Policki, Shorette and Serafin ended the scoring with the Lancers leading 16-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after Tellier closed out the fifth frame, the game was over as the Lancers cruised into its doubleheader against Plainville on Friday with the 16-0 win against St. Paul Catholic.</p>
