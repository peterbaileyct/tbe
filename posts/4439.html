<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team picked up another victory against Bristol Central on Friday night, winning the game by a 69-37 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A quick game summary was posted in TBE but here are some notes from the city series showdown at Bristol Central:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*For the second straight game, Eastern shot the ball extremely well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Central, the Lancers hit 25-of-55 field goals for a 45.5-shooting clip.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along those lines, Eastern flipped in 9-of-19 shots from 3-point land and out-rebounded the home squad, 47-30.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Central did extremely well in taking care of the ball, committing just 10 total turnovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those numbers are typically higher in a city series showdown game but the Rams kept Eastern from making it and up-and-down affair via fewer miscues on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is excellent in the transition, up-tempo game it loves to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Eastern junior Ciara Collins is trying to score her 1,000th point in this shortened season. And if everything falls into place, she has the chance to accomplish that amazing feat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Rams, Collins had a double-double <em>before </em>the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She tallied 20 points and 11 rebounds at the half - finishing the game with 29 points, 14 rebounds, and six assists as Collins flirted with a triple-double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Ella and Brooke Watson led the charge for the Rams with 17 combined points. Ella zipped in a team-high 10 points while Brooke posted seven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scoring against Eastern in a city series bout is never an easy thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Four total players from Eastern scored 10 or more points against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with Collins, Sage Scarritt canned a 3 on her way to 12 points, 12 rebounds, two assists and two blocks over an excellent complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cali Doyon netted 10 points and two assists while Alyssa Kehler added 10 points and seven rebounds to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Central’s Janessa Bartell is a hustler, zipping up eight points and played very good defense against all those Eastern bigs while Arianna Rivera scored seven to help the Rams’ cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Taigan Parent (two points, five rebounds, three assists) made good contributions over her second consecutive start for Eastern while Emma Stavens, Audrey Tice and Vanessa Drury - all three in their freshmen campaign - each notched a hoop for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Midway through the second stanza, Central trimmed Eastern’s edge to 10 points (26-16) before the Kingstreeters settled on a 33-18 edge at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Lancers scored 19 straight points to open the third quarter to wrangle up a 52-18 cushion with just under three minutes left in the period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The last time Central defeated Eastern was back on February 16, 2004 as the Rams were 60-57 winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have won every showdown since, a streak that started in 2005.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*This week, Tuesday’s upcoming games have been moved to Wednesday with Central hitting the road to take on Southington (1-1) while Eastern makes it home debut against Plainville (2-0).</p>
