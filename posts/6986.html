<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is there an exact reason why people have stopped attending scholastic sporting events in Bristol?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s this alarming trend in the city as crowds have dwindled at all high school games, seeing mostly family and friends at the events.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I just don’t get it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can’t point to the pandemic because this has been happening long before the world went upside down.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People simply aren’t going out to Bristol Central, Bristol Eastern, Muzzy Field and all these other local venues where some exciting things are happening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means people are missing out on seeing some extremely talented young men and women take to the fields and courts, duking it out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can’t imagine people missing out getting a closer look at Bristol Eastern’s Ciara Collins who is going to be the all-time leading scorer for the girls basketball program before heading off to play in college.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or the outstanding Victor Rosa from Central before he sprints on over to UConn to play a little football.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s these below-the-radar, collegiate caliber athletes competing all over the Mum City and getting a chance to watch them play locally is a treat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that generation of fans – who used to go out to Central, Eastern, Muzzy Field and the like to take a peek at our scholastic athletes – are no longer doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my opinion, it’s a complete shame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are the factors that have stopped fans from attending scholastic events?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is it the level of competition?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think the Central Connecticut Conference is the best scholastic set-up in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The playing field is as level as it could be and any team has a chance of knocking off another (unless your squad employs a 7-foot-2, fire-breathing, basketball giant that’s headed to UConn…).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have people have simply lost interest in high school sports all together?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buying a ticket to those CCC events, the ones that charge, isn’t all that expensive and some of that money goes to support the schools as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These young men and women are putting it all on the line for 20-something games every fall, winter, or spring season and what would it hurt to come out to a game or two?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those student athletes, some of which won’t be competing collegiately, are playing for the love of the game, and it’s simply amazing to see what these athletes can accomplish on a nightly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And watching the competition is just plain old fun.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, if you attend the right game, you might even see a little scholastic history along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is it the AAU effect, with certain athletes wanting a more specialized playing field that costs thousands of dollars to join?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s true with baseball and a bad trend is forming.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you were a high school baseball playing in the early 1990s, you’d play summer baseball in town somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol American Legion baseball was, and still is, an excellent choice for a summer league.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why pay to play somewhere else and then have to pony up for gas, lodging, food, and whatever else is involved with these growing travel programs?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 has been a model of consistency, plenty of eyes are on the program, and it’s a place you can play and learn from some excellent coaches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jim Ziogas, Spec Monico and Jerry LaPenta are all superior mentors and coaches you can trust.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fundamentals are important and all three of those men are helping those players continue to excel.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with fewer players trying out to play, that means the stands aren’t as full and as Bristol American Legion Baseball continues to win (the senior program was a sterling 19-7 this year), no one is seeing it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s so strange watching Post 2 compete for a Zone 1 title in front of 50 or 60 fans.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muzzy Field is a short drive from anywhere in Bristol. What’s the deal here?!?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even our friends – the Bristol Blues – had some of the smallest crowds since the program was reestablished over at Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Cape Cod League Baseball, the New England Collegiate Baseball League has an array of talented players and plays an exciting brand of ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The complaint I heard from the Bristol end was that the Blues didn’t have a local player attached to the team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where were all the Bristol players that could be on the roster for this squad?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jagger Duquette played for the New Britain Bees of the Future Collegiate Baseball League, and it seemed wrong that the talented pitcher, Bristol Eastern alumni to boot, isn’t suiting up in a Bristol Blues uniform every night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can point to the pandemic but even with all the tomfoolery out there, the Blues simply did not draw like past years. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is it the lack of media coverage, giving the games a less importance or not allowing readers to know – and follow – the local teams competing in the city?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People say that I cover the Bristol America Legion baseball team like the New York Yankees.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, that’s how the daily paper in town <em>used to</em> cover Post 2 20 years ago when I was writing for them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing has changed for me but the climate around the city is different, I guess.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the daily covers fewer and fewer events, it’s nearly impossible for people in Bristol to figure out what is going on scholastically.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for me, it’s not as complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who doesn’t want to come down to historic Muzzy Field for a baseball game?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We haven’t filled Muzzy Field for anything since 2005 or so.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even our biggest game of the year, the "Battle for the Bell," used to be a huge event from Muzzy Field every Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In year’s gone by, an estimated 5,000 people would attend the game and if you got there after 9 a.m., you’d be parking your car near the Bristol Center Mall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was tailgating, a meeting of old classmates and friends, and the game was always a treat for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, if you get 800 people to attend, that’s a big crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about we try to reverse this course?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the pandemic is all said and done, why not take the family out to a football or basketball game at Central or Eastern?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or a baseball game from Muzzy Field?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s always a good time, the price is right and our athletes in town would really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you’ll never leave disappointed.&nbsp;</p>
