To get things rolling, I am inviting individuals to gather in the first small writing group. The group is limited to eight. Regarding participation--this is important--it is not necessary to have "great" grammar skills. What is necessary is the willingness to work on your writing to develop your story.

If you are interested in joining one of the groups, please send the following:

<strong>o     A brief bio--100 words or fewer, including your overall writing goal or mission.
</strong>

<strong>o     A description of your current project or a project you would like to work on.</strong>

<strong>o     What is it you expect (need) from the Writing Room community to complete your project.</strong>

<strong>o     What it is you have to contribute to the Writing Room and a work group.</strong>

<strong>o     Your availability. There will be regular meetings and attendance is mandatory.
</strong>

<strong>o     A list of any writing that you have completed, not necessarily work that has been published.</strong>

Topics for writing projects may vary, but typically will fall under one of the following:

<strong> o     memoir--perhaps you would like to write about a particular insight into your own life by stitching together a series of events occurring over time that together have come to have special meaning; </strong>

<strong>o     expertise--something that makes you an expert, from the sciences or arts or life experience that you can share with others to illuminate understanding;</strong>

<strong> o     research/history--something that intrigues you or that you were present for.</strong>

Please note: Any of these might be a subject for a good story. What we will be working on together is long-form journalism storytelling technique.

Please send your information to dfortier@bristoledition.org. Deadline for applications is Sept. 8. Notification will be by Oct. 15. The first meeting will be held early in November.
