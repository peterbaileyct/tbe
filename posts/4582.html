<p>The Connecticut Passion AAU boys basketball program has a couple local players hitting the courts in Bristol and St. Paul Catholic senior Tommy Lorenzetti is one of those standouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And his Twitter page says it all:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eat. Sleep. Ball. Repeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those are words to live by if you love the hardwood as much as Lorenzetti obviously does.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior, a 6-foot guard - just like the guy with the same name at Bristol Eastern, circa 1991 - is a very good shooter from deep and able defender to boot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the younger Tommy might not connect on as many 3s as the elder one did for the Lancers (Eastern’s Lorenzetti hit a then program record 47 three-pointers over 1990-91 during his senior season), schools have already lined up to recruit the St. Paul Catholic standout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti certainly has suiters and he’s going to eventually find the best NCAA Division II or III landing spot that will help him obtain his education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And why not throw up a three-pointer or two in the process?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Programs interested in Lorenzetti include Wentworth, the University of New Haven, New England College, Elms College, Western New England, and Dean College among others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not all about the scoring as a true elite hoops’ programs need players of every shape and size to be successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior has dedicated himself to his craft.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti hit the weight room over the offseason and improved his three-point shooting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s the defensive component of his game that makes him a viable collegiate player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The New England Recruiting Report, a website that focuses on scholastic standouts on the court, had a glowing report of what a program can expect from the talented guard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lorenzetti is a hard-working, unselfish, two-way player,” according to the website. “He shares the ball, works hard on both ends, and puts the team's success above his individual stats. He not only approaches the game the right way though, he's also able to execute. He's fundamentally sound with a high basketball I.Q. and so he's a reliable decision-maker who can come off pick-and-roll and is increasingly capable of knocking down open shots.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget the 3.5 GPA at St. Paul Catholic as Lorenzetti would like to study pharmacy in college.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s one of the leaders of the St. Paul Catholic boys basketball program this year, helping the squad to an early 1-1 record - including yesterday’s 70-63 upset of No. 5 Naugatuck in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti flipped in 13 points, including two three-point bombs (surprise), in that huge win over the Greyhounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Falcons’ first game of the year, a tough 67-57 loss at Seymour, the sharpshooter also canned two 3s on his way to six points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, that outstanding defense doesn’t show up on the stat sheet but every local coach and scout can see exactly what Lorenzetti is all about when he enters the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as the season continues for the senior, expect another college or two to reach out for Lorenzetti’s services before he makes his ultimate decision about his playing future.</p>
