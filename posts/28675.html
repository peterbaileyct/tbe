 Among the usual participants of a ribbon cutting, tucked away in the background are a few of the owner makers taking a chance on the newly operating Bristol Bazaar. Among the makers is, in the white chef's hat, Jeff Tedesco of La Familia Tedesco. Care and Eric Verikas, center in pink hoodie and yellow t-shirt about to cut the ribbon, are the prime movers behind Bristol Bazaar.  | David Fortier
