<p>As the sun rose Monday, Oct. 7, 1918, at 6:53 a.m., Bristol Police Detective Edward Cullem rose his stocky 5’10" frame and readied himself for work.&nbsp; Despite nursing a cold, he had reason to feel pretty good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Officer Cullem apprehended two suspects wanted regarding a burglary at the Lester Clothing Store in the preceding days. With some good detective work and the aid of the Terryville and New Britain Police Departments, the two suspects were in custody in a Bristol jail cell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there was a string of robberies concerning a Pequabuck department store, the Terryville train station, and a Bristol retailer that he was close to resolving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As he stepped out into the crisp morning air from his home at the west end of Laurel St. at No. 179, which he shared with his wife Mary, Detective Cullem did not have far to walk.&nbsp;Police headquarters, located at 15 N. Main, was four-tenths of a mile away.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proceeding down Laurel, he passed Hotel Butler, George Stecher’s delicatessen, and the shoeshine stand nestled between barber Francesco Martellitti and the proprietor William Treutlein who owned City Bakery, which had fresh loaves of bread, cookies, and pies that teased and seduced passersby in the store window.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>N. Main brought Bristol Hardware, restaurants, and a newsstand where you could get the Bristol Press for two cents and for one additional “wheat-back” the Hartford Courant.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crossing the alleyway that separated buildings, he then entered the first floor of 15 N. Main St., but unbeknownst to Detective Sergeant Cullem, as he navigated his way through the labyrinth of filing cabinets and desks to his office is this would be his final commute because, within 72 hours, the 38-year-old would be dead.</p>

<h2>The Pandemic </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In June of 1917, John T. Black was appointed state health commissioner with a salary of $4,000 a year. At the time of his hiring, he had no way of knowing that in 427 days, a pandemic would engulf the state and kill 9,000 residents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the Spanish flu spread across Connecticut in the early fall and citizens became alarmed, Dr. Black urged cities and towns not to close schools or churches, despite all industries being affected.&nbsp;Instead, the Department of Health banned playing cards in saloons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you close public gatherings, you assume that it will stop the epidemic. Well, it won’t.&nbsp;Closing theatres, schools, and churches will have little effect unless you go ahead and close factories, offices, and railroad trains,” Black explained.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Black was also no fan of masks. His department recommended using gauze masks where exposure was most certain. However, he thought it was futile to wear face-coverings while walking the streets, as done in several communities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the second week of October, though, with the death toll climbing rapidly and cemeteries overrun, local leaders ignored the health commissioner and began closing churches and schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Bristol, there were only 18 “mild” cases of Spanish Influenza on Sept. 27.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Oct. 5 though, by order of Bristol’s acting health director Dr. Henry B. Spring, schools, churches, and theatres closed and would remain closed for a month.&nbsp;One week later there were 1,000 Bristol cases, including 400 at New Departure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the mounting cases, amateur sports carried on.&nbsp;In Bristol, The West End, Bristol's amateur football team, played through the pandemic, which did not come without a cost.&nbsp;Andy Muckavich, their star halfback, died in mid-November due to influenza and pneumonia after only being sick a week. He was 26-years-old and was in the middle of his first season with the club.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It is not like the government did not know the Spanish flu was coming.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The troops fighting in the European theater were infected and suffering, and stateside military camps on the east coast, where recruits were training and preparing for war, reported 23,000 influenza cases.  And troop transport headed to Europe were infected.  By the end of the war, 45,000 American soldiers died from Spanish flu. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Throughout the pandemic, our government leaders were mostly silent.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An examination of the Bristol Press from October shows no statements by or articles mentioning Mayor Joseph Dutton urging residents to protect themselves. This is not to infer that he did not care. Far from it. His niece Chloe was infected with the grippe (the term at the time) and he did plead with state officials to secure more doctors and nurses for Bristol because many were overseas with the war and those that remained were among the sick. (Curious as to how Dutton’s administration handled the pandemic internally, I requested their records from the city. Unfortunately, that information no longer exists.)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gov. Marcus H. Holcomb was mostly quiet too, much like Dutton. You will be hard-pressed to find any front-page stories with the governor regarding the pandemic. A review of the Hartford Courant for October shows no front-page stories with Gov. Holcomb and the pandemic. The scant stories about the pandemic are lost among the war reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about President Woodrow Wilson, you ask? The president never issued a public statement about the pandemic because he did not want anything to interfere with the war effort.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, what would why would the mayor and the governor have what appears to be tepid public reactions to a pandemic that was laying siege to their residents?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus was the war and due to wartime censorship, the goal was to downplay the flu and keep morale amongst citizens and soldiers alike, while preventing the enemy from knowing the extent of the outbreak as well. To ensure that war morale did not falter, the federal government had a willing partner in that endeavor.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Edward J. Cullem</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Detective Cullem left work Monday, Oct. 7, because he was feeling ill.&nbsp; On Oct. 9, he was transferred to St. Francis Hospital for treatment. Despite being under the constant care of two nurses and a physician, his condition worsened.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Shortly after 8 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 10, Detective Cullem died.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Edward J. Cullem was born in Bristol on Aug. 28, 1880, and was the son of Mr. and Mrs. John Cullem. Edward attended Bristol schools and following graduation, he took up employment as a clerk for grocer James Monaghan.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>He resigned to become a police officer and received his appointment on Feb. 3, 1906.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Along with his parents, he was survived by his wife Mary (Brouillard) to whom he married in October of 1909 in Unionville, and by two brothers and two sisters.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Colleagues and associates of Detective Cullem admired him for being even-tempered, fearless, and a man of excellent judgment with sympathy for the less fortunate.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>His obituary read, “In his death, the city loses a substantial citizen and a true and faithful servant. He had the confidence of every businessman in the city, the esteem, and regard of all who knew him. The sympathy of the entire community goes out to the family and their great loss.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What Do you Say, Partner?</strong></h2>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to state records, Bristol’s most challenging period was the weeks of Oct. 12 and Oct. 19, with 30 reported deaths each week. Despite crowded obituaries in The Bristol Press, the news from the battlefield dominated the front page.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Due to the “Great War,” a nursing shortage existed, so on Oct. 7, the state appealed for doctors and nurses to help with the pandemic. The Press published the request but tucked it inside on page 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Newspapers throughout the country reported constructive pandemic information, but nothing that could be interpreted as unfavorable or critical.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is not as though death and suffering were a secret to newspaper reporters. Indeed, the reporters lived in the neighborhoods, and they were talking to relatives, friends, and neighbors and heard the stories. &nbsp;In fact, amid the madness, S. Taylor Baldwin, the Hartford Courant reporter assigned to cover Bristol, died due to influenza and pneumonia on Oct. 21.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The closest the Press ever came to being critical was the partial publication of a report by Dr. J.B. White of the United States Public Health Services.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because Bristol needed medical professionals, the United States Public Health Services sent Dr. White to Bristol to treat the ill. Dr. White was here for more than a month and saw countless patients and visited the stricken homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While his assignment was concluding, he issued a report to the state detailing what he encountered by writing, “I saw instances where as many as eight or ten in one family were so prostrated, they were utterly unable to render assistance to each other.” This situation repeated itself in many homes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The report went further concerning the conditions he found, “But from my own personal observation in Bristol I venture to state that the extension of the epidemic in certain parts of your city is easily accounted for by the plague of flies, which infested certain unsavory localities furnishing fertile breeding spots for these pests as a no-doubt carried infection to better and remote sections of the city.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dr. White’s findings were partially published by the Press the last week of November. By then, though, the war was over, and the Spanish flu had nearly run its course, and the daily comings and goings had mostly returned to normal. (I inquired with both the state and the local health department’s for a full copy of the report, but it no longer exists.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Through the pandemic’s turbulent months (October-December), the Bristol Press and the Hartford Courant published modest warnings on protecting against Spanish influenza. Bristol Press readers would have to read between the lines and put all the stories together to know a problem was at hand by scanning the obituaries and the gossip column that reported who was sick in town.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How could this be?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><b>The Espionage and Sedition Acts of 1917 saw to it.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The law (acts) passed after the U.S. committed to entering World War I was designed to limit dissent by criminalizing any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language” about the U.S. government or military, or any speech intended to “incite insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty.”&nbsp; Newspapers faced with such threats could be shuttered, fined and jailed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Wilson administration muzzled the media and newspapers regarding the pandemic. Not wanting to appear unpatriotic or face prosecution, the media went along.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One newspaper, the Jefferson County Union of Wisconsin, was threatened with prosecution. The newspaper published a report advising that the Spanish flu was more severe than the public was led to believe.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Newspapers like the Bristol Press did not have the means to stand up against such threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The fervor of patriotism was dripping everywhere.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For example, in May of 1918, Rev. Theodore Beussel of the German Lutheran Church on Judd St. was arrested for sedition and convicted in July (a future story we are working on). What did he say? Among several statements, the ones that stood out were that the conflict was a Wall St. War, and the Kaiser was a better leader than President Wilson. He was sentenced to ten years in prison, and his U.S. citizenship was revoked (Wilson pardoned Rev. Beussel after the war).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Bristol Press took note.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, Oct. 13, at approximately 2 p.m. and under the canopy of a seasonal fall day, a large contingent of family, friends, and local dignitaries attended the funeral of Officer Edward C. Cullem.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Among those in attendance included Bristol’s governmental body from Mayor Dutton to the city council, police chief Ernest T. Belden and the entire Bristol Police Department dressed in full uniform.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The solemn funeral at Officers Cullem’s parents’ home at 18 Prospect Place had many floral tributes adorning the house from family and friends, including a large broken wheel from the police force.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The service, conducted by Rev. Thomas J. Keena of St. Joseph Parish, followed the Catholic funeral rites and traditions. The bearers were police Chief Belden, Officers Doyle, McGillicuddy, Lambert, Duffy, and Rourke.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was a tribute to Officer Cullem that so many attended. At the time, the city was about to hit its peak of Spanish influenza-related deaths. Over the next two weeks, another 60 residents would succumb while countless others would suffer but outlast the disease.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Following the ceremony, to avoid the railroad tracks, which was the custom, the mourners took an unconventional route to St. Thomas Cemetery for the committal service.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Officer Cullem is buried in the family lot located at the east end of the cemetery.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Last Waltz </strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>“I mean, they say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time.”&nbsp; ― Banksy (</em>street artist, political activist, and film director)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Spanish flu killed 50 million worldwide, 675,000 Americans, and 9,000 Connecticut residents. It was the most destructive force since the Middle Ages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In just three months, 113 Bristol residents (official state number) perished, and another 2,000 were sick. Yet, there is no memorial or acknowledgment.&nbsp; No annual retrospectives, historical programs, and no thank you to the doctors and nurses who came to Bristol in its time of need to aid and comfort the ill and dying.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Flood of 55 garners much historical attention in town. There are annual retrospectives, video montages, newspaper articles, and remembrances, and yet no one died; only buildings and property were destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average age of death was between 20 and 40 years old; the victims struck down in the prime of their lives. For many, their lives never had the opportunity to flourish. The youngest acknowledged death in Bristol is 2-months old, with at least 10 deaths under the age of 2, which does not include infant deaths at the time of birth to mothers who died due to Spanish flu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before writing a word about the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, I knew very little. The extent of my knowledge was there was a pandemic called the Spanish flu, and many died. Through this experience, I learned that my great grandmother died at the Parish House and viewpoints can sharpen, and matters can come into focus when there is a personal connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among Bristol’s dead were mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters and singers, umpires, laborers, engineers and volunteers. The fabric of a vital community that makes it prosper and grow.</p>
<p>Perhaps if the pandemic of 1918 was given more attention and scrutiny, the problems we face with our current dilemma would not be so harsh.&nbsp; For those keeping score at home, we are 0-2 when it comes to how we handle pandemics.</p>
