<p>At 3:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, Bristol Police reported receiving multiple 911 calls of shots fired from various locations in the downtown and southwest areas of the city, including Woodland Street, Peck Lane, and South Street Extension.<br><br>Officers responded and observed a white Audi fleeing from the area, traveling north on West St., away from the South Street Ext. area. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Multiple officers made attempts to stop the vehicle, but were unsuccessful.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Audi was encountered by another officer moments later on East Road and the officer reported that the vehicle drove at him head-on and attempted to ram his cruiser. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other officers continued to search for the vehicle and located it again, in the area of Seymour Street, where the vehicle was stopped and two passengers were seen exiting the vehicle.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The vehicle then accelerated at another cruiser, and the police officer was forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision. <br></p>

<p>The fleeing vehicle drove up onto a lawn, back onto the roadway, and fled the area, with officers attempting to catch up to it. The suspect vehicle then intentionally rammed into a cruiser that was responding to the area. The officer was not injured, but the cruiser sustained damage that was extensive enough to warrant removing it from service for repair.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The suspect vehicle continued through the city, eventually getting onto Rt. 72 heading eastbound. In the area of the Rt. 72 and I-84 interchange, the fleeing vehicle suffered a mechanical failure as a result of the previous evading accident and striking the police cruiser, bringing the pursuit to a stop. </p>

<p>The suspect was then taken into custody without further incident. Officers observed what appeared to be evidence of fireworks in the vehicle. At this time, the Bristol Police Department canâ€™t confirm if the sounds heard were gunfire or fireworks. The investigation is ongoing.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two passengers who exited the vehicle were located, interviewed, and released without charges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> It was later determined that the vehicle was also involved in an evading accident on Wolcott Street at East Road.<br><br>The operator of the vehicle, 24 year old Joseph Abreu of Hartford, was charged with 3 counts of Criminal Attempt to Commit Assault on a Police Officer, Reckless Driving, Engaging Police in Pursuit, Evading Responsibility, Operating with a Suspended License, Improper Turn, and Criminal Mischief 1st Degree. He was held on 3 separate bonds totaling $1,050,000. <br></p>

<p>A firearm has not been located at this time.<br><br>Abreu is also wanted by the Connecticut State Police on charges of Engaging Police in Pursuit for an unrelated incident.</p>
