<p>The Lancer volleyball team ran their record to 8-0 with a quick 3-set sweep of Plainville Thursday in the Eastern gym.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first set was actually the most competitive of the afternoon as Eastern prevailed, 25-10.</p>

<p>After that, the Lancers were the proverbial runaway freight train, winning sets 2 and 3 by identical scores of 25-4. Coach Stefanie Reay took the opportunity to play everyone on the varsity bench with such a one-sided score.  And everyone on the team took full advantage of their chances, with multiple underclass players showing off their skills.</p>

<p>Statistically, the Lancers were led by Amber Champagne with 8 aces, 1 kill and  2 digs. Abby Jones had 4 assists and 2 aces, and Hannah Podolak chipped in with 4 assists.</p>

<p>For their next match, Eastern travels to Southington on Monday, October 26.</p>
