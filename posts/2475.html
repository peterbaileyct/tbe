<p><strong><em>CITY HALL ANNOUNCES RE-OPEN PLAN</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>(BRISTOL, CT) – Bristol City Hall will re-open for on a by appointment basis starting Monday, June 22, 2020, with a full re-opening to the public on Monday, July 6<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; “We are putting protocols in place to ensure that both city employees and our citizens are protected when visiting City Hall,” said Mayor&nbsp; Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “We have been at 100% work capacity with the doors closed for the last 3 months and have been able to service all customer needs over the phone, via the internet, and by meeting people at the door when necessary. We encourage people to continue to call into City Hall and transact business using the city website when able to, to cut down on traffic in the building.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting July 6<sup>th</sup>, the building will be open to the public with some modifications. “Recognizing that many people like to pay their taxes in person and receive receipts, we have repaired the Tax Drive Thru window and that will be open for use,” said the Mayor. “We also want to remind everyone that the City chose to defer payment of July 1 taxes until October 1, 2020 without interest or penalties, so this will hopefully reduce the lines. You may also pay your taxes online, or mail them. There is also a drop box in the wall at the North Side Lobby where people may deposit their payments.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Due to the small vestibule areas in many of the offices, there will also be social distancing circles to denote where the lines should form. Plexiglas barriers have been installed on all of the counters and citizens will be asked to wear masks and there will be sanitizing stations,” said Councilman Peter Kelley who chairs the city Building Committee. He also noted that the first floor bathrooms will be available for public use, while the remaining bathrooms on other floors will be for employee use only.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harley Graime, the city’s emergency management director, has been accumulating Personal Protective Equipment for employee use, including gloves, which will need to be changed frequently by those offices handling paperwork and cash money. “It’s also important for people to stay home if they are feeling sick,” Graime said. “We will be cleaning the building, contact points, public computers and ensuring there are masks and other supplies, we need to stop the spread of this community transmitted virus.”</p>

<p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TAX DEFERRAL</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER 7S</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What does the Deferment Program mean?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an extended grace period program for upcoming Real Estate, Personal Property, and Motor Vehicle tax bills due on July 1, 2020, with the exceptions of escrows and landlords. It defers the payment deadline until three months from the tax due date, instead of the usual 30 days. Interest will not be charged during those three months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When is a deferred tax bill due?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deferred tax bills are still due July 1, 2020, but the interest-free grace period is now extended until October 1, 2020, instead of the deadline being August 3, 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Whose tax bills are covered under this deferment?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any resident or business owner who will have unescrowed real estate, motor vehicle, or personal property tax bills due July 1, 2020 (with the exception of landlords, unless they qualify). Landlords must submit an application with documentation by July 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020, and be deemed eligible for the deferment per the requirements in section 6 (c) of the Governor’s Executive Order 7S.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do landlords need to do in order to qualify?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Per the Governor’s Executive Order 7S, all landlords must submit an application with supporting documentation to the Tax Collector’s office by July 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020 in order to qualify for the deferment. The documentation must provide proof of a significant decline in income or that commensurate forbearance was offered to their tenants or lessees. If a landlord does not apply or does not qualify for the deferment, the tax bills will still be delinquent after August 3, 2020 and interest will be charged based off of the original July 1, 2020 due date. Applications will be available to download from the Tax Collector’s website starting on May 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020, and can be submitted electronically to taxoffice@bristolct.gov</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is the penalty to pay a deferred tax bill on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2020?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interest is based off of the original July 1, 2020 due date, so an October 2, 2020 late payment would be charged 6% interest. Per state statute Sec 12-146, even one day late generates the month’s interest charge, so it would be 1.5% for each month (July, August, September, and October) that the bill has existed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Do delinquent bills get an extension of time?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No.&nbsp; This pertains only to new tax bills for July 1, 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How is my escrowed real estate tax bill affected?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your real estate taxes are escrowed, the bill is not deferred per the Governor’s Executive Order. The bank or mortgage company is still required to pay by Monday, August 3, 2020. If they are paid after August 3, 2020, they will be charged interest of 1.5% per month based off of the original July 1, 2020 due date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do I pay my bill?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mail tax payments to:&nbsp; Tax Collector, City of Bristol, PO Box 1040, Bristol, CT&nbsp; 06011-1040</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Mail: Mailed payments that are delivered after October 1, 2020 must have an official USPS postmark of October 1, 2020 or prior, or they will be considered delinquent and charged interest.</p>
