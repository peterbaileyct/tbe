<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did the Bristol Merchants of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League end up winning the postseason championship in 2008?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad was once again stacked that year as head coach Bunty Ray returned most his team that won both the regular season and postseason GHTBL titles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GHTBL was celebrating its 79th year and the Bristol Merchants were looking for its fifth consecutive finals appearance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray returned Kevin Rival, Brian Archibald, Rick Hewey, Eric Butkiewicz, Nick Hudyma, and Chris Strahowski to the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other key performers included Rick Barrett, Drew Sgro, Joel Stamilio, Adam Peters, Chris Klepps, Jay Maule, Ryan Dudzinski, and Paul Franceschi.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants did not bring back GHTBL Rookie of the Year Sean Allaire who was putting together one of the greatest offensive careers in Central Connecticut State University baseball history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol squad entered 2008 winning three of the four past GHTBL postseason titles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Merchants were 24-10 and battled ProCare of Meriden in the tournament finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol starting winning right off the bat as the season commenced on May 28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defending champs put up a two-run victory over the Jets from McKenna Field in East Hartford, opening the season as 3-1 winners.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stamilio collected two hits including a double and an RBI, Klepps added an RBI single while Peters put together an RBI ground-out for the Bristol outfit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald won the game for the Merchants, chucking a three hitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on July 17, in a rematch with the Jets, Butkiewicz threw a no-hitter, facing just 28 batters, walking none, and just a first inning error thwarted a perfect game as the Merchants blanked East Hartford by a 4-0 push in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Klepps had three RBI while Maule scored three runs for the Merchants (6-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A quick two game losing streak was followed by more winning as Sgro collected three hits, two runs scored and two RBI in Bristol’s 8-6 victory over New Britain from Beehive Field on June 30.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hudyma won the contest for Bristol as the program won its 10<sup>th</sup> game of the season (10-2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After beating the Avon Legion team by a 12-3 push on July 12, Bristol moved to 12-3 overall but the squad hit the wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants split its next five doubleheaders, going 5-5 over that stretch, playing .500 ball and falling to 17-8 overall as People’s eventually won the regular season championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amazingly, the first three Bristol defeats were all by one run, another came in the 12<sup>th</sup> inning (8-3 against Foss) while a 4-2 loss to Bill’s Sports Shop was the biggest non-extra inning setback during that 10 game stretch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was a frustrating 10-pack of contests as Bristol allowed just 2.6 runs-per-game to the opponent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants averaged 3.7 runs over that same stretch but just broke even against the competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the final day of the regular season on August 3, Sgro belted a two run double - part of a four-run sixth inning - as Bristol got past Simsbury by a single run, 4-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hewey went the distance on the hill to earn the win for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the power of its 19-8 regular season finish, the Merchants earned a bye and didn’t play for a week due to the weather.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open postseason play on August 10, Butkiewicz earned the victory for the Merchants, going seven innings, allowing just two hits while fanning 10 in a 3-1 win over Avon Legion from McKenna Field in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two days later, Bristol lost to ProCare 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald was excellent, throwing a two-hitter that included three walks over seven innings in a tough losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol fell to 1-1 in tournament play and had to fight its way out of the loser’s bracket to get back to the GHTBL finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On August 12, Bristol started a four-game postseason winning streak, opening up with a loser’s bracket victory over Foss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants scored several early inning runs as Bristol nabbed a four-run win over Foss Insurance, 7-3.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strahowski (5 IP) won the contest for the Merchants as the offense came alive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A four-run first inning was all the winning side needed to take the victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rival came through with a two-out RBI single that made it a 2-0 game and Sgro followed up with a two-run double and at 4-0, it was more than enough to topple Foss after just one inning of play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had to win twice on August 16, defeating both the Vernon Orioles (5-3) and Bill’s Sports Shop (10-3) to go 4-1 in postseason play - qualifying for the title round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ProCare was undefeated in the playoffs and battled Bristol on August 17 for the GHTBL championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants had to beat ProCare twice to win the postseason championship and nearly accomplished that feat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After defeating ProCare 5-1 over the first contest, Bristol fell by one in the final game of the year, 5-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After defeating the Meriden outfit by four runs in the first contest of the day, it forced a winner-take-all championship final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first game saw Klepps slam a home run in the first inning, plating another run in the third, and when Sgro flipped in a two-RBI single in the fourth, it was already a 5-0 game and the contest was out of reach for ProCare.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hewey earned the win on the hill, allowing just four hits, as Bristol qualified for the final, championship game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a twenty minute break, the championship contest commenced but game two saw Meriden run out to an early edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rob Tencza (5.1 IP, home run, three RBI) slammed a two-run home run in the first inning and Meriden added another in the second as the team nabbed a 3-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Klepps drilled out a homer and an RBI single by Franceschi in the bottom of the second cut the deficit to 3-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sgro added a two-run single in the third and going into the fourth frame, it was a 4-3 lead in the Merchants’ favor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But luck ran out for Bristol in the bottom of the fourth as Meriden notched two runs on two errors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tencza drilled an RBI single to tie things up at 4-4 before he stole second and arriving at third via error.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He later scored on a throwing miscue by the Bristol catcher when a third strike ball was dropped as ProCare zipped up a 5-4 lead that held up for the remainder of the championship game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having to play so many elimination games in a row, a tired Bristol squad simply ran out of gas, and arms, in its quest for an upset championship bid.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Year end Awards</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
