<p>EDISON PARK, NEW JERSEY - Bristol Central boys cross country standout Nate DeAngelo is having a senior season to remember.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He continues to win races in Central Connecticut Conference, Region B action, but recently DeAngelo traveled outside the state of Connecticut where the speedster continued to excel, continued to impress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a warm Halloween afternoon, DeAngelo took a shot at the 5k event from the Garden State Track Club High School Fall Showcase Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior placed near the top of his event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several athletes from the Nutmeg State competed in the 5k challenge and DeAngelo earned a medal with an amazing third place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo ended the race with a blazing time of 15:01.66 which included a final 66-second lap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning the 5k race was Gavin Sherry of Conard who blitzed the course for a time of 14:30.37 while Jackson Barna (14:35.76) of Basking Ridge, New Jersey was the runner-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sherryâ€™s time was the fourth fastest ever clocked at the Golden State Invitational.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Athletes from Conard, Hall of West Hartford, Manchester, Avon, Norwich Free Academy, and Simsbury also ran well in the 3k and 5k challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo and the Rams are back in Connecticut and have their final regular season meet this Wednesday at Farmington from the course at Winding Trails.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
