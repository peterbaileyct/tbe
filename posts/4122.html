<p>In 2021 the Bristol Education Foundation (BEF) will be celebrating 30 years<br>of supporting innovative programs in the Bristol Public Schools. Established in 1991, the BEF was started by a group of educators who were passionate about quality education and looking for a way to supplement the educational opportunities offered to Bristol students. Today, the Business Education Foundation is a collaboration between the Bristol Board of Education and the Central Connecticut Chambers of Commerce. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Foundation funds, promotes, and supports educational endeavors aimed at improving learning, achievement, skill development,<br>creativity and excellence in teaching. The BEF has spent the last 30 years working to help insure that Bristol’s students have the necessary<br>opportunities to develop the skills and attitudes our community will need in the future. The Foundation supports programs that have made a lasting impact on the Bristol schools and its students.<br></p>

<p>Since 1991, the BEF has awarded over $400,000 to Bristol educators allowing them to bring their innovative visions and educational desires to reality. This is due to the generosity of donors within the Bristol community – businesses and individuals who are passionate about quality education.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BEF concentrates on providing the additional financial resources, support and advocacy needed to move that base of excellence to a higher level. The BEF Board of Directors sustains the important work through the continued support of these innovative programs:</p>
