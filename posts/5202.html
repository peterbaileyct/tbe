<p>The City of Bristol issued the following news release on April 22:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two Griffin Health vans will be deployed to Bristol and will be located at the Mrs. Rockwell’s building, next to the playground on Friday April 23, and Saturday April 24, from 12 to 6 pm each day. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each van will have between 100 and 125 Moderna vaccines for a total of approximately 250 vaccines per day. The clinics will be staffed by Griffin Health personnel and the National Guard. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This clinic is open to Bristol residents ONLY who are 18 years or older – appointments are not needed. Those who receive a vaccine will be given assistance to schedule their second vaccine appointment when the vans return to Bristol from May 20 through May 22,” said Mayor Zoppo-Sassu.</p>

<p>“Bringing mobile vaccination units to Bristol is an opportunity to reach those populations here in Bristol who lack technology and transportation or who have language barriers,” stated Councilman Peter Kelley, who represents the neighborhood around Rockwell Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, a Mobile Vaccine Clinic will take place at First Congregational Church on Federal Hill and at Asbury United Methodist Church in Forestville on Sunday, April 25 from 11 to 5 pm to administer first doses of the&nbsp;Moderna&nbsp;vaccine to Bristol residents who are 18 years or older. The vans will then return on Sunday, May 23 to administer the second doses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are continuing to work with the State to reserve these Mobile Vans for additional dates next week and beyond,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “People should check the City website, Mayor’s Office Facebook page, or call the Mayor’s Office at 860-584-6250 for location and times. It is to all of our benefit to encourage our friends and neighbors to get vaccinated as well.”&nbsp;</p>
