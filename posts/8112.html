<p>It is with sadness that we announce the passing of our family’s matriarch, Dawn (Brouker) Norton, 90 years young. To know Dawn was to love her. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was born on Oct. 22, 1930&nbsp; to the late Raymond A. and Mary L. (Peck) Brouker and raised in Bristol until her passing from this earth on Sept, 16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She cherished all of her family, living and passed. Dawn and her husband Richard “Dick” Norton, who predeceased her in 1991, raised their young family, Cynthia and Bradford, at Lake Compounce later moving to California and then returning to Bristol where they enjoyed many years of happiness with their family and countless friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dawn enjoyed the simple pleasures in life; a glass of wine, weekly pizza nights with her family, cheering on all of her grandchildren at many sporting events, and afternoons at the movies with her sister, Virginia. She always looked forward to her brother Dale’s visits to Connecticut and the time they spent together. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She cherished her friends and all of the meals and fun times. She had a beautiful eye for decorating, loved antiquing and she treasured family heirlooms and history. Time with family was most important to her and she was a fixture at every celebration. Dawn enjoyed each day and made sure those around her did, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After retiring from the State of Connecticut-Department of Veterans Affairs she took great pleasure in volunteering her time as a mentor at Jennings School that would ironically years later become her home, Meals on Wheels, and the Plainville Food Pantry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dawn is survived by her daughter Cynthia (Gunter) Smith, son Brad (Gail) Norton and her grandchildren; Heather (Michael) Torpey, Carly (Carl) DuCharme, Chelsea (Rick) Block, and Taylor (Abby) Norton. She found great joy in spending time with her great-grandchildren, Claire and Aiden Torpey, Kai Block, Logan and Rowan Norton as well as her many nieces, nephews, cousins and dear friends near and far. She is also survived by her sister Virginia Kalbach and brother Dale Brouker. In addition to her husband Dick, she was predeceased by her beloved brothers Clyde Brouker and Richmond Brouker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dawn will be forever remembered for her generosity, independent spirit and deep love of family. Her happiness was in her family’s happiness. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calling hours will be held from 4 to 7 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 23 at Funk Funeral Home, 35 Bellevue Ave., Bristol who has the honor of serving Dawn’s family. </p>
