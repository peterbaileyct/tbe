<p>The newly nicknamed Nor’Easters gave the Lancers tough battles all through the evening, but Eastern always had what it took to salt each set away when the going got tight.</p>

<p>The second set was the best of the night. Newington jumped out to an early lead, and they held on to it for almost the entire set. But the Lancers roared back, fueled on by a raucous student cheering section, and pulled even and eked out the set by sweeping the last few points, with a 26-24 second set result.</p>
