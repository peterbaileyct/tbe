<p>For the second time in 2021, the boys basketball squad from Bristol Eastern is looking to get above .500 but will have to do it against a very scrappy team led by a very familiar face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers took it to Southington last Saturday and now, Lewis Mills of Burlington is on the docket and that’s no easy task for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans, despite a sub-.500 ledger, have been extremely competitive under former Bristol Eastern JV coach Ryan Raponey and everyone expects a war of near epic proportions on Tuesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the deal between the two programs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (2-2) at Lewis Mills (1-2)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time –&nbsp;</strong>6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong>&nbsp;– from the gymnasium at Lewis Mills high school</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The question – </strong>Does the squad that drops in the most three-pointers win this game?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is extremely possible that both the Eastern and Mills programs could combine to attempt 50 three-pointers on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is not an exaggeration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol Eastern player and coach at Lewis Mills has shooting weapons all over the court and position 1-5 for the Spartans will have dangerous, scoring options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s defense will be tested, as it's difficult to know who to guard on any given offensive set because of that long range marksmanship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nate DiChiara, Tommy Martinotti, Drew Cormier, and Brice Waldron are all capable of double-figure scoring efforts for Mills and that’s a challenging offense to contain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In both losses to date for Mills, the squad was in both contests before bowing out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even at 1-2 this season, Mills has shown defensive abilities and a willingness to compete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills defeated Plainville (47-46) to open the campaign but dropped decisions to both New Britain (55-45) and Farmington along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program is currently on a two-game skid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, speaking of three-point shooting, there’s a flip side to that conversation Mills will have to contend with as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s offense is chucking up 25 three-pointers a game and four players average at least one make from downtown every game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether it’s team leader Elijah Parent (16.3 points-per-game), Trini Otero (12.5 ppg) or Josh Kolano (11.8 ppg), the Lancers’ offense is more than a little diversified from outside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>X-factors like Jack Stavens (11 points against Southington), Nasir Walker-Jenkins (nine points, three assists versus the Knights), Dylan Woodsome and Tyler Donohue can also have breakout games as well. And those first three mentioned will let it fly from long range as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has done an excellent job as of late taking care of the ball, posting a season-low five turnovers against Southington in the Lancers’ 59-49 win from last Saturday in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More impressively, Eastern nearly carries an even steals-to-turnover ratio on the year as the squad is getting the job done defensively and taking care of the ball on the other end as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This should be an evenly matched game – and a fun one as well as Eastern travels to Burlington for CCC Region B action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games on the horizon:&nbsp;</strong>Eastern at New Britain (Friday, February 26, 6:45 p.m.); Eastern at Avon (Monday, March 1, 6:45 p.m.).</p>
