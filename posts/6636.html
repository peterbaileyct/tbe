<p>The Connecticut Senior American Legion State Regional Qualifier – a different tournament than the traditional postseason set-up – will begin on July 24 and the squad from Bristol is still in the hunt to qualify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ten teams will be competing in a qualifying tournament with the victor advancing to the Northeast Regionals with a shot at the World Series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That winning squad will not play in the state tournament in 2021 as the American Legion baseball regular season was extended this year due to the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the Connecticut State champion will not advance to the Northeast Regional which is slated to commence on August 3 from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams eliminated from the tournament qualifier are eligible to play in the traditional state tournament which begins August 3 – the same time as the NE Regional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who gets to play in the Regional Qualifier?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top two teams in each zone as of July 22 will get an invitation to the qualifying tournament which will run July 24-31 from the friendly confines of Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the winner of the Northeast Regional will advance to the American Legion World Series in Shelby, North Carolina.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams that are eliminated from the qualifier can continue its regular season trek and qualify for the 32-team state tournament.</p>
