<p>BRISTOL - Today's second round Class LL softball game between Bristol Central and Cheshire will now commence from Casey Field on Middle Street at 3:15 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central's softball field would not be ready in time for the showdown as the recent rain has made the facility unplayable for the contest.</p>
