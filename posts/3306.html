<p>The Rams set the tone early when Charlie Pittman sped down the left wing and hit a hard shot into the far side of the Lancer net just two minutes into the game.  </p>

<p>Then late in the first half, at 37:00, Umar Malick hit a shot that eluded Lancer goalie Nate Diloreto for a 2-0 halftime lead.</p>

<p>"Central came out strong, moved the ball well, and we didn't respond," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.  " We played better in the second half, but still Central kept us from getting into any offensive flow."</p>
