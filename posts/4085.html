<p>The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference Board of Control approved the Winter Sports plan on Thursday - meaning sports would be commencing at the scholastic level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, local schools and facilities in Bristol will be bustling with the sounds of basketballs falling through the hoop and a little splashing in the pool as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practices can commence starting on Tuesday, January 19 with games beginning on or about February 8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Twelve regular season games will be permitted in girls and boys basketball, boys ice hockey, girls gymnastics and boys swimming,” according to a release from the CIAC. “A postseason experience in all sports will be allowed from March 15-28. Those experiences will be championships at the league level. In order to maximize the number of game opportunities for all schools, no CIAC state championship tournaments will be held in the winter sports season.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, the phrase ‘postseason experience’ was used - meaning that the squads of the CCC Southern division will be competing for a playoff title as a group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s all not good news as a squad like the boys basketball team from Bristol Central, a state contender in hoop, would rather be competing for a CIAC title instead of playing for a regional one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, wrestling, competitive dance and cheer will not be taking place due to the sports being in the ‘high risk’ category.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The winter sports of wrestling, competitive dance and competitive cheer are classified by the Connecticut Department of Public Health as high-risk activities, and thus will be limited to small group conditioning and non-contact skill building,” said the release. “The low-risk sports of sideline cheer (no stunting, lifts, or tumbling) and exhibition dance (no lifts, stunting, or tumbling) may continue, provided participants wear masks and formations maintain six feet of distance between athletes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And boys and girls indoor track could be shelved as well due to the lack of facilities, travel, and shear size of multiple teams competing at the same venue during a meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Boys and girls indoor track teams will be limited to practice with indoor/outdoor meets considered no earlier than March,” according to the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the raging pandemic, the Winter Sports plan “is a fluid document and will be updated as more data, health metrics, and sport specific information become available.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol will have both boys and girls basketball and boys swimming on the docket in February.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other schools that have ice hockey and gymnastics will see those programs commence but - just like in basketball - all participants, including coaches and officials, will be wearing masks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All participants, coaches, and officials will utilize a mask that completely covers the nose and mouth, and that is worn directly on the face, at all times including during active play,” according to the CIAC release. “The latest guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that youth athletes wear cloth face coverings when they are on the sidelines, in the locker room, and traveling as well as during group training and active competition (except in pools or while using certain gymnastics apparatus).”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While the CSMS Sports Medicine Committee does not have any data to confirm the necessity or effectiveness of wearing masks while actively competing in interscholastic competition, it recognizes DPH’s position and supports the CIAC continuing with winter sports under DPH’s mask requirements.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In basketball, mask breaks will be added to the current timeout allotment, lasting one minute in duration, and there will be plenty of social distancing on the bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the CIAC will allow cheerleading at basketball games as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopefully, those athletes will be able get out to games and cheer on those players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In alignment with DPH guidance for sports published on November 9, 2020, the low risk sport of sideline cheer (no stunting, lifts, or tumbling) and exhibition dance (no lifts, stunting, or tumbling) may continue provided participants wear masks and formations maintain 6 feet of distance between athletes,” said the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, situations can change in an instant but it’s looking good for our athletes in the Mum City as winter sports are ready to commence despite COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The CIAC emphasizes that this plan is fluid and in a perpetual state of evaluation,” said the release. “COVID health metrics and data in Connecticut will continue to be closely monitored and the appropriateness of holding youth sport and/or interscholastic athletic contests can change at any time. The CIAC will continue to consult with our stakeholders and will adjust offerings as appropriate, including the suspension of interscholastic athletics, should the health metrics direct that action.”</p>
