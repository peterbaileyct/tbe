<p>Under the watchful gaze of a hazy summer sun, Bristol firefighters Scott Poulton, Jim Marks, Adam Hayes, and Paul Maghini, were busy laying turf and making other upgrades to the Fallen Firefighters Monument on Sunday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“The monument was originally built in 1972 by Captain Murphy and was in need of some repair,” Jim Marks said. &nbsp; The Bristol Fallen Firefighters Monument is dedicated to the deceased firefighters who died in the line of duty in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;“The work on the site should wrap up next week,” Poulton advised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Located at the Fire Department Headquarters, the monument section is on the corner of North Main and Center Streets.&nbsp;The area will now have an International Association of Firefighters Monument and the Bristol Fallen Firefighters Monument, along with a 9/11 Monument added to mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project is funded by residents, private businesses, the firefighter’s union, and local grants.</p>
