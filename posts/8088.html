<p>BRISTOL - If the CIAC decided to commence the state tournament today, the Bristol Eastern football team would make up part of the Class L field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s been a long time since the words ‘Lancers’ and ‘state tournament’ were part of the same sentence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a long way to go in 2021 but off an encouraging 2-0 start, there’s plenty of optimism going around the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A big part of that surge has been the outstanding play of senior running back Alex Marshall - well on his way to a 1,000-yard rushing campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In just two contests this year, he’s amassed 337 total yards and five touchdowns - including a career-single game-high of 243 rushing yards against Edwin O. Smith during Week 1, leading to an easy 35-6 win for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Put everybody on our schedule on notice that Alex Marshall is for real,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He crashes into opposing defenses with reckless abandonment and ruthless aggression - two traits that make up every special player who takes the gridiron on a weekly basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the gaudy offensive statistics are just one part of what makes Marshall so special.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s one of the squad’s vocal leaders and when he speaks, it very obvious that his teammates listen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marshall gets the job done on both sides of the ball and his defensive efforts are just as impressive as his offensive numbers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is already one of the team’s leaders in overall tackles and tackles-for-losses this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s been a senior leader for us the entire season,” said Julius of Marshall. “He’s got tremendous work ethic and he’s an excellent runner.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this team doesn’t bring a ton of 11v11 football experience to the fold this year, the team got plenty of reps in the condensed 7vs7 campaign last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those reps have paid dividends as the Lancers have taken advantage of what Edwin O. Smith and RHAM allowed them this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That fast start has made that weird 7vs7 pandemic campaign a quick thing of the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The 7v7 that we did last year was eerie,” said Julius. “It was quiet. I think people could hear me too much, though every body can kind of hear me [anyways].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone certainly heard Julius at the end of the RHAM game this past Friday when it appeared the Raptors were going to steal the game away from the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the closing play, with RHAM making a four-yard reception to get to the Eastern one yard-line, time should have run out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, through confusion on the official running the game clock, the Raptors scored on a one-yard plunge at the buzzer - a play that should have never been allowed to commence in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the touchdown was signaled, Julius ran onto the field, stated his case rather forcefully about the timing of the final play, and the officials realized a mistake was made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The touchdown was called off, Eastern seized a 13-7 victory over the Raptors - meaning the Lancers moved to 2-0 overall and that sure felt better than previous starts at Eastern in recent memory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I couldn’t be happier for my kids,” said Julius. “I couldn’t be happier for their parents because I can’t even imagine not being able to watch your child play the sport they love. To get the players out here [against E.O. Smith] in front of the student body, there was a buzz in the building all week about this, [and] for our guys to come and put on a great performance for us was really, really awesome.”</p>
