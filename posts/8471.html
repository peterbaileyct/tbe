<p>Come Sunday morning, I will rise and shake my head and wonder where the week went. It’s not that much happened, although on the city news front there was a candidate forum at the Senior Center, which I could not attend because I was at work. If you know anyone who was there, maybe, ask them how things went.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, it is a city election year—remember Nov. 2, it’s right around the corner—and there will be more forums. There is another this Monday evening, sponsored by the NAACP, and held at Prospect United Methodist on the corner of Summer and Center streets at 7 p.m.  </p>

<p>Speaking of the NAACP, it’s former president and local businessman Lexie Mangum, celebrated the 40th anniversary of his barber shop, now located on Main St., last weekend. That’s worth a mention. Congratulations, Lexie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another evening, I will have encountered a skunk in our driveway. I got in late, after night fall, and being the first one home, since these are all long days for Mary, I decided to walk around front and get the mail. Halfway, I noticed something out of the usual, and there it was, walking toward me on the opposite side of the driveway—a skunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without thinking, I turned around and limped away, but not before noticing that my new acquaintance, paused and turned and waddled away in the opposite direction. All I know is that I made it back to the back steps and upstairs without further incident. I walked through the house to front door to check the mail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cool days and evenings are welcomed. They are a sign, perhaps, that in these unusual times—of&nbsp;climate change with its surprisingly strong, startlingly strong and sudden storms and warmer temperatures—that perhaps we will still have seasons, and the turning of the seasons will bring with them something of the normal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary has put out the mums on the front stoops and they are about to bloom. The buds, yellow and orange, are pea sized. Soon they will pop. Others around the neighborhood have already bloomed, and once again, noticing these, I am reminded what I nice job the neighbors have down with their own hanging plants and those others decorating their lawns. They just make things better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now, with Halloween on the horizon, the neighbors are busy again decorating their yards with purple and yellow and green cobwebs, goblins and ghosts, skeletons and witches, black cats and broom&nbsp;sticks, graveyards and orange lights. It’s all&nbsp;pretty impressive, and it’s obvious that people have put some time and energy into the presentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week’s homework is more of a fun thing, that is if you are curious about Mozart. Open Source with Christopher Lydon is one of the oldest running podcasts and one of my favorites. In a recent program, he and his guests discuss, and play, Mozart, and, for my money, there is nothing more interesting than listening to well-informed people talk about things they appreciate and know about. Here’s the link. Click&nbsp;<a href="https://radioopensource.org/thoroughly-modern-mozart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
