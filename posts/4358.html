<p>The Bristol Central girls basketball squad was hoping for another consecutive state tournament appearance this year but the pandemic – and the CIAC – had other ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the scholastic season has been reduced to twelve games in 2021, the Rams are going to give it their best shot over the next month or so.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still a bit on the youthful side, head coach Steve Gaudet has some good scoring options in the starting line-up while the bench may earn minutes under a little baptism by fire.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever the case might be, Central is finally getting back to playing basketball on Tuesday and this is what to expect from the Rams program this year:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL GIRLS BASKETBALL&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Steve Gaudet (17th season)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record</strong>: 6-15 overall (No. 27 Bristol Central lost in first round of Class L state tournament to No. 6 Sacred Heart Academy)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record:&nbsp;</strong>In 16 seasons at Central, Gaudet is 82-242 overall&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key players</strong>: Gwen Torreso (sr, guard), Janessa Bartell (sr, forward), Sophia Torreso (so, forward), Ella Watson (jr, guard), Damani Hough (sr, guard), Brooke Watson (fr.).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths:&nbsp;</strong>Experienced, returning players&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses:&nbsp;</strong>Youth, inexperienced bench&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Central will be successful</strong>:&nbsp;Two last names: Torreso and Watson. And if everything goes right, there will be a combined four players with those last names who should be heavily contributing this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fun Fact:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Since the 2012-13 campaign, the Bristol Central girls basketball team has qualified for state tournament play over 50-percent of those seasons</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Not So Fun Fact:&nbsp;</strong>The last time the Rams won multiple state tournament games in a single postseason, Coach Gaudet was still playing baseball for the squad at Assumption College in Worcester, Massachusetts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview:&nbsp;</strong>The girls over at Central had a credible season in 2019-20, winning the most games for the program since the 2014-15 campaign and made a return to state tournament play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the postseason isn’t in the cards anymore for scholastic basketball in the state, the team is looking to improve as the season unfolds and hopefully, partake in whatever tournament is put together by the Central Connecticut Conference at the completion of 12 games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the best thing for the team from last season was the fact that there wasn’t a senior to be found and most of those contributing underclassmen are back for another round.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s some experience in that starting line-up which is an obvious strength of the squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Sophia Torreso (11.5 points-per-game in 2019-20) had a huge campaign and will look to improve upon her all-around solid game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso led the team in field goals made, total points while canning 15 three-pointers along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s a player that isn’t afraid of the bright varsity lights and deserved an All-Conference nod last year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, her growth is critical to the long-term success of the team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t be surprised if she becomes the third 1,000-point scorer for the Central girls program by the time her career is over.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And sister Gwen Torreso does a little of everything for the squad, pitching in nearly four points-per-game last year but her value was underestimated when looking at the final numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’ll rebound a bit, can find the open the player and the senior leader can help move the program along.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Janessa Bartell (8.4 ppg) is an extremely versatile athlete and can get on a roll when the offense is flowing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her return to health is a critical part of Central’s success.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Ella Watson (5.6 ppg) was also a key component to last year’s team and if she can continue to produce, the Rams will continue to have a bright future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watson was second on the squad in three-pointers made (9) and should be among the leading scorers for Central once again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damien Hough (2.2 ppg) is the squad’s other senior leader and a player who took the floor for all 21 games last year for Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s another guard who factors into the mix on both sides of the ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The critical ingredient for Central this year is getting some production off the pine.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaudet carries a very youthful bench and while a player or two saw some minutes here or there last season, getting any kind of contribution can only augment the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s another Watson in the mix, freshman Brooke Watson, and it should be interesting to see what she can bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaudet had a boatload of freshmen and sophomores and if the long-time mentor can squeeze something out of those underclassmen, the Rams might be able to surprise a team or two along the way in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing is ever easy for the Bristol Central girls basketball program but for 16 years, Gaudet has done a commendable lob leading the team despite not having multiple All-Conference caliber players that most schools enjoy from time-to-time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as always, Gaudet and his staff will work hard and get maximum effort out of that young group of athletes. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
