<p>NEWINGTON – Apparently, Bristol American Legion baseball pitcher Roberto Cruz loves to square off against Newington this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 has taken on the Newington squad three times this season, zipped up a perfect 3-0 ledger against program, and Cruz has won on the mound in all those games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday, Cruz came into pitch for Mike Lorenzetti during the fourth frame, throwing three innings of three-hit ball, as Bristol nabbed a 4-3 victory from Alumni Field in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals are 15-5 overall and 13-4 in Zone 1 play. Bristol now sits in the drivers seat of Zone 1 with three games left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington fell to 6-10 off the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz allowed a single unearned run, walked three and fanned four over an efficient 59-pitch stint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He came in for Lorenzetti who, for the second straight start, did not allow a hit over his time on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In four innings, Lorenzetti yielded one earned run, walked seven while punching out eight to earn a no-decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the plate, Bristol’s Andrew Lozier was nearly perfect – going 3-of-4 overall – which included a double and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Brown, Adam Caron, Evan Bouchard, Tyler Martin, Owen Davis, and Jack Kozikowski all generated hits for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown added an RBI via a sacrifice fly and scored two runs while Davis also notched a run and an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 stole six bases on the night, advancing whenever it could, as Brown had two to lead his squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austyn Howe pitched well for Newington but could never get over the hump as he went the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Newington tallied 10 walks, but the offense could not generate a game-winning hit as it stranded nine batters on base over the losing endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a back-and-forth affair early as Bristol scored a run in the top of the third, but Newington responded with one in the fourth to tie the game up at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 nabbed another run in the fifth to go ahead by one,but when Newington tallied two in the bottom of the stanza, the home team led 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scored two in the top of the sixth and Post 117 never responded over the final two frames as Post 2 grabbed a big 4-3 come-from-behind victory to earn its 13<sup>th</sup> win in Zone 1 play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Up-coming schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has won seven straight Zone 1 games – and 12 out of its last 13 – and plays at Avon tonight (5:30 p.m.) from Buckingham Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the rubber match between the squads as each team has won a game earlier in the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally, a non-zone game at South Windsor was on the docket but was cancelled due to the Avon make-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, Bristol battles West Hartford from the friendly confines of Muzzy Field with a start time of 7 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is another make-up game and West Hartford will be the home team in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then this coming Sunday, Post 2 travels to Memorial Field for an early 11 a.m. showdown against Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That will be the final day of regular season play as the 2021 Senior single elimination postseason tournament commences on August 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll have more on the state tournament as the week comes to a completion.</p>
