<p>Manheim, Pa. -&nbsp;Just because COVID-19 cancelled the collegiate season for several NCAA programs, there’s still plenty going on behind the scenes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in terms of wrestling rankings, a local grappler continues to carry a presence on the national scene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Wrestling Coaches Association has announced&nbsp;the first edition of the Division III Coaches Rankings on January 21, including the individual top-10 ranking and the team tournament top-15 poll, and Chris Trelli from Springfield College was featured in the latest rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trelli, a former Bristol Central standout, appeared in the first national rankings of 2021 for the NCAA Division III program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, he’s ranked ninth at the 141 pound weight class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trelli, in his junior year for the Pride, was recognized with NWCA All-America honors a season ago following his qualification&nbsp;for the 2020 NCAA Division III Championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Entering this year, Trelli was moving up a class in weight and his abilities are well-respected in and around the Springfield program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season at 133 pounds, Trelli had one heck of a year - going 23-4 overall while finishing third at the regionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the 2021 rankings has multiple Pride wrestlers on the list from a squad that finished in fourth place at last seasons NCAA Division III Regional Championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With 10 wrestlers ranked in each of the 10 weight classes, Springfield College was one of only 17 programs in the nation to have at least three wrestlers [including Trelli] in the national rankings, and one of only two from the Northeast region,” according to the Springfield website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a sophomore in 2019-20, Trelli was named to the National Wrestling Coaches Association 2020 Division III All-America teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Springfield, one of the top NCAA III programs in the New England area, had three other student-athletes who were recognized along with Trelli.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol standout earned&nbsp;the honor after qualifying&nbsp;for&nbsp;the 2020 NCAA Division III Wrestling Championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trelli picked up third team accolades.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During that busy sophomore campaign, the Sports Biology major from Bristol - at the wrestle backs of the regionals - put together&nbsp;five consecutive victories after an opening-round loss, advancing to the national level event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic cancelled the collegiate wrestling season for the Pride this year but Trelli and the Springfield program hope to bounce back when sports - and life in general for that matter - resumes a bit of normalcy in 2021-22.</p>
