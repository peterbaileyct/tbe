<p>Connecticut's primaries have been moved to early August. With that in mind, I checked in with Jennifer Brunoli of the City of Bristol Registrar of Voter’s office to find out what expect. She directed me to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.ci.bristol.ct.us/1048/VOTING-COVID-19" target="_blank">city's Registrar of Voters Voting and COVID-19</a><a href="http://www.ci.bristol.ct.us/1048/VOTING-COVID-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.ci.bristol.ct.us/1048/VOTING-COVID-19" target="_blank">webpage</a> where I found the following information. </p>

<p>First, by the end of June, every eligible voter in the either the Democratic and Republican parties will receive an absentee ballot application. Both parties are fielding primaries, despite all challengers having dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>So every eligible voter in Bristol will be able to vote by absentee ballot, with one important reminder.&nbsp; For your vote to count, it must be received by the close of polls on election day, Aug. 11. Voters have until Aug. 10 to register.</p>

<p>Second, the <a href="http://www.ci.bristol.ct.us/1048/VOTING-COVID-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">city’s plan</a> as of now is to consolidate voting to three polling places, in accordance with the Secretary of State’s “Safe Polls Plan,” which seeks to limit person-to-person contact at the polls and expand the absentee ballot access.</p>
