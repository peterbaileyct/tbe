<p>The City of Bristol is encouraging all residents to help themselves and the community stay safe by downloading the newly launched COVID Alert CT App, which notifies you if you have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 without disclosing your location or any of your personal information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>COVID Alert CT is a voluntary, anonymous, exposure-notification smartphone app. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will get an alert if you were in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19. Knowing about a potential exposure allows you to self-quarantine immediately, get tested, and reduce the potential exposure risk to your family, friends, neighbors, co-workers and others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The app is available in multiple languages and can be used on Android and iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For iPhone/Apple Devices</strong> <br>Follow these simple steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Go to Settings > scroll down to find Exposure Notifications >Turn on Exposure Notifications</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Tap Continue to select United States, then choose Connecticut</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To verify that the exposure notifications are enabled on an iPhone, you should see that the Exposure Logging Status is set to Active and there will be a green checkmark next to it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For Android Phones/Devices<br></strong>Download the COVID Alert app from Google Play Store at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.ct.covid19.exposurenotifications">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.ct.covid19.exposurenotifications</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> To verify exposure notifications are enabled, open the app, click on the Settings tab and ensure that Exposure Notifications are set to “On”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can now review and check the last 14 days in the Exposure Logging Status, share a COVID-19 diagnosis, and turn on availability alerts. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This app is only going to be as strong as the participation rate is,” said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu who subscribed to the app on Thursday night.</p>
