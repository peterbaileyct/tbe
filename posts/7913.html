<p>The Bristol Eastern Girls Soccer team lost a close match to Berlin Monday night, 4-3, in a contest in which each team took turns seizing the momentum. Unfortunately for the Lancers, Berlin had the answers for much of the second half, and Eastern, in spite of a three goal effort by Ciara Collins, dropped to 0-2 for the early season.</p>
