<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;When the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern girls tennis teams clashed on Friday, the match could have gone either way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The programs were even through four singles matches but the Rams won two of three doubles encounters – seizing a 4-3 CCC South win from the tennis courts at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers fell to 4-11 off the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern nabbed the top two singles matches while Central earned wins in the other two showdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Central took victories in the first and third match of doubles play to secure the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In number one singles play, Eastern’s Brooke Treannie defeated Ava McCann over a very competitive bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treannie ended up on the plus side of a 7-6, 6-3 decision.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At No. 2,&nbsp;Brianna Kelley was able to topple Central’s Melaney Dam by set scores of 6-3 and 6-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Rivera, Central’s number three singles competitor, beat Ava Gesner (6-0, 6-1) and in the No. 4 slot,&nbsp;Samantha Chapman turned away Eastern’s Trisha Mohan (6-1, 6-0).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in doubles play, the Rams were able to secure two critical wins. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s top doubles combination of&nbsp;Brooke Rinaldi and Alexa Rinaldi had their hands full against Ashlee Lewandoski and Jenna Cefaly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a close game, but the Central duo won via scores of 7-6 and 6-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At No. 2, Eastern’s outstanding twosome of&nbsp;Adrianna Reay and Olivia Dossias defeated Elizabeth Martin and Emily Sosa over another excellent showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay and Dossias took the first set 6-0, dropped the second by a 2-6 score before seizing the tiebreaker (10-7) to help the Lancers tie things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central was helped at No. 3&nbsp;Hannah Krueger and Sydney LaRosa as the duo toppled Gina D’Angelo and Kiana Ouellette (6-2, 6-2) as the visitors won the match, 4-3.&nbsp;</p>
