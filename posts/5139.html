<p>The Bristol boys swimming &amp; diving co-op had an outstanding season in the pool this past winter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant more than a couple postseason awards were in store for the Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern/St. Paul Catholic contingent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[I’m] very excited to announce that the Bristol Coop has four All-State Boys Athletes during this very interesting season,” announced head coach Adrienne Bentley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those 2021 C.H.S.C.A. All-State boys swimming honorees are Gabriel Bartolome, Drew Fries, Colton Litwinczyk and Mikel Palaj.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three of the athletes are seniors along with Palaj who is a junior and will be returning to the pool at the Dennis Malone Aquatic Center next season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bartolome earned All-State for his efforts in the 200 Medley relay and the 200 Individual Medley.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fries, a Bristol Eastern boys basketball letter winner during the 2019-20 campaign, took home the All-State award in the 200 Medley Relay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Litwinczyk was chosen for his work in the 200 Medley Relay while Palaj was a big-time performer in three different events (200 Medley Relay, 100 butterfly and 500 Freestyle).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a testament to the work, time, and effort those boys have put into the program over the years, under the tutelage of Bentley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the times these athletes finished with in the pool weren’t just noteworthy but of record setting proportions as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 200 Medley Relay, the combination of Bartolome (bk), Litwinczyk (br), Palaj (fly) and Fries (fr) ended up placing 11th in the state with a time of 1:39.48.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That impressive finish helped establish a new team record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bartolome also put himself in the Bristol record book by placing 13th and setting a new team standard in the 200 Individual Medley with a finish of 1:57.56</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Palaj placed eighth in the 100 butterfly and his time of 51.36 seconds established another Bristol team record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, Palaj earned 14th place in 500 freestyle with a time of 4:52.26 to help complete a busy season of fun in the pool for the frogmen from Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Litwinczyk, the Bristol swimming coop senior captain recently announced he will attend Bryant University and swim for the Bulldogs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bryant is a NCAA Division I institution and will be getting a fantastic athlete that’s going to help elevate the Bulldogs’ program in the pool, inside the classroom and on campus as well.</p>
