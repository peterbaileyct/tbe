<p>Bristol Central football star Victor Rosa finally made his choice about his collegiate future public on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, just like his All-State basketball teammate Donovan Clingan, his pick was UCONN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa committed to the University of Connecticut, taking the field for the Huskies in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was announced on Twitter by Rosa in a 17 second video that saw a husky eventually pop on the screen with another shot saying ‘Victor Rosa Committed’ in a UCONN uniform.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally, Rosa was going to make his decision known sometime in June, but that local choice was certainly worth the wait.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcement ended up being a birthday present for his mother, Deanna.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice keeps Rosa in Connecticut, enabling the outstanding athlete to earn his education and play a little football just up the road where friends and family can watch Rosa compete from Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UCONN is becoming a hotbed for athletes in our state once again – proving that the Huskies and their programs can attract top-tier talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Rosa is top-tier talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a sophomore at Central, he made 177 carries for 1146 yards and 19 TD’s while at quarterback, Rosa threw 31-of-79 passes for 475 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since that time, Rosa has been putting in the work, attending various football camps and turning the heads of several collegiate scouts along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has all the necessary tools to be a successful NCAA Division I football player at UCONN under head coach Randy Edsall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several other programs were interested in Rosa which included Yale, Boston College, the University of Maine, the University of New Hampshire, and the Air Force Academy to name a few.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa had an unofficial visit to UCONN in early June and that visit helped shape Rosa’s ultimate decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He recently received his initial rating from @247Sports as Rosa was announced as a three-star recruit with an 86 rating, making him the highest ranked student athlete in the CIAC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa is one of those hybrid football types who could be following in the footsteps of former Bristol Central standout D.J. Hernandez – another local who suited up for the Huskies (2005-2008).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hernandez could do it all, starting at quarterback and then moving to wide receiver for the program to end his collegiate career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was an extreme athlete, a two-time captain at UCONN and was exactly what the Huskies needed at that time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa could fill a role like that as well, racing all over the gridiron in multiple offensive capacities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Versatility is king and Rosa is a nimble player with speed, guts, and guile that matches up well with his intelligence and leadership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 6-foot, 193-pound senior Athlete is extremely fast, running the 40 in just 4.4 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also finished the 100 meters in 10.7 seconds and the 200 in 22.2 seconds this year for Central’s boys track &amp; field program in the spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about his 4.3 Grade Point Average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a professional football career isn't in the future for Rosa, he’ll have a degree in hand and all the drive in the world to be a very successful man in whatever he decides to accomplish.</p>
