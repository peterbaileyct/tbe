<p>BRISTOL - In another close match, the Bristol Eastern boys soccer team fell in the closing minutes against East Hartford - dropping a tough 2-1 decision to Hornets in a CCC Interdivisional showdown from Alumni Field in Bristol on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The win moved East Hartford to 2-7-2 overall while Eastern fell to 2-8-1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hornets notched a 1-0 edge over first half play as the opponents scored just 2:30 into the fray.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers ended up misplaying a ball and it fell to the feet of Braydon Richardson who blasted it home for a score.</p>

<p>However, that one goal lead would not last as Eastern scored the equalizer midway through the second period.</p>

<p>This time, Dom Femiak sent a long, high ball that just eluded the outstretched hands of East Hartford keeper Lesly Pinthiere (eight saves) as the bout was all tied up at 1-1.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We had the momentum, but missed some shots, and played too much to their central defenders," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.</p>

<p>Late in the showdown, on a cross to Pedro Luis, the offender beat the Eastern defense to the ball - tapping it in for a 2-1 lead as the game-winner sealed the deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dylan Piazza made nine saves for the Lancers over another solid eighty minutes of play.</p>

<p>Eastern is back in action next Tuesday from Middletown in a CCC South tilt.</p>
