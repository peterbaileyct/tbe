<p>Several scholastic athletes from Bristol have put together remarkable seasons in track &amp; field this past spring.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve had athletes establish new school records while several younger runners have made significant gains from the early month of April - leading to top performances in the Class L and MM championships from last Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those tremendous showings qualified several athletes for the CIAC State Championship Track and Field meet from Willow Brook Park in New Britain this Tuesday.</p>

<p>Sophomore, junior, and senior classes will be represented by the Bristol public schools this year at the statewide event.</p>
