<p>WORCESTER, Mass. - When former Bristol Eastern girls soccer standout Myah Croze made the decision to attend Western Connecticut State University, it was only going to be a matter of time before her scoring exploits were going become major news.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in WestConn’s first match of the season this year, the junior from Bristol quickly collected game-winning scoring honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday, the midfielder notched the game-winner with less than three minutes remaining in the match, propelling the women's soccer program to a 2-1 victory in a non-conference tilt against Worcester Polytechnic Institute&nbsp;from Alumni Stadium.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by a goal, WPI tied the contest at 1-1 over the 60th minute of play and it appeared the match was headed for a possible overtime session.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was a 1-2 punch by Bristol Eastern’s finest as senior Carly Martin was tremendous in the goal - scooping in 10 saves - and kept it a 1-1 stalemate before Croze put together game scoring heroics.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with 87:13 left in regulation, Western’s Suzana Imetovski found a charging Croze and when she flicked the ball into the WPI net, WestConn led 2-1 and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze ended up taking two total shots on goal that day, converting on her second attempt that proved to be the game-winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin had another tremendous outing at the keeper position, stopping 10 of 11 shots over ninety minutes of intense action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a freshman in 2019, Croze played in all 22 contests for the Colonials - helping the squad to a 14-6-2 overall record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She co-led the program in goals with 18 and etched up five game-winning scores that season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze also collected two assists while notching 38 points overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin also had an active 2019 campaign, competing in all 22 matches as opponents scored just 26 goals against the then sophomore - posting an excellent 1.31 goals allowed average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She made 105 of the program’s 120 saves that season.</p>
