Once again, apologies for the slow development of Bristol Edition. Things will pick up. In the meantime, I have a request. I am looking for 8-12 people to help me out with my master's project (as a journalism educator) focusing on citizen-based community journalism. (In other words, people like you and me will discuss and produce news stories about our city for the people in our city.) There is no age or education requirement, just a commitment to a minimum of two hours a week over the next four weeks, beginning Jan. 21. If you are interested, please leave a comment. I will get back to you with more details.
