<p>WINDSOR - The Bristol Eastern softball team has never enjoyed much luck against CCC interdivisional challenger Windsor on the road over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a huge victory against Southington the previous week, the hope was a little of that momentum would follow the Kingstreeters up Interstate 91 to Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Warriors’ received a huge effort from star pitcher Taylor Falatico who threw her way to an impressive 4-2 victory over Eastern from the softball field at Windsor high school on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors moved to 3-1 over the winning effort while the Lancers fell to 1-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Falatico pitched extremely well behind a two-run, four-hit effort that included 13 strikeouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She moved to 3-1 overall off the winning effort while Eastern’s Allie Tellier hung in tough as well but just didn’t get any support from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern pitcher allowed just three hits and gave up only one earned run overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jasmine Perez smashed a two-RBI double for Eastern that was good for the visitors only extra-base hit of the outing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Romero and Olivia Casciano each doubled for the Warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor notched single runs in the first and fourth frames while collecting two insurance scores in the bottom of the sixth stanza to net a huge cushion in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Windsor scored right away to put the visitors behind early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the first inning,&nbsp;Romero led off with a double and later scored on an RBI groundout&nbsp;by Brianna Bailey to make it a 1-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s defense kept it a one-run contest until the bottom of the fourth when the Warriors added another tally to the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor’s Shannon&nbsp;Douglas got on base via error and from there, she scored off an RBI single by Addison Shaffer and going into the fifth inning, it was a 2-0 game as the home team stayed in charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the sixth, the Warriors made it academic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Douglas earned a lead-off walk while Casciano doubled, scoring Douglas, to make it a three-run push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the scoring, Casciano scooted home on a wild pitch to make it a 4-0 game as Eastern&nbsp;was down to its final three outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers tried to make a game of it before eventually bowing out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier and Riley Giblin both scooped up base hits that put two runners on and then Perez slammed out a two-RBI double as the deficit was split in half, 4-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern never got any closer as the Kingstreeters fell by two to drop to 1-2 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTE…</strong>Since taking over the program in 2013, Redman has won nearly 62-percent of his games as Eastern’s coach, but his team is just 1-3 in games against pesky Windsor.</p>
