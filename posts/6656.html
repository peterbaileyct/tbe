<p>NEWINGTON – The Bristol American Legion baseball team had another one of those home-away-from-home contests on Tuesday afternoon - this time against Newington in a Zone 1 attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a make-up game between the squads as Post 2 was the ‘home’ team from Legend’s Field in Newington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the location did not matter as Bristol pitcher Roberto Cruz threw an 82-pitch, complete game gem as Post 2 nabbed a 3-1 victory – moving to 13-4 overall and 11-4 in Zone 1 play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington fell to 5-9 overall as Post 117 is 0-2 against Bristol this sumer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz dominated as he allowed just one run on four hits, walked one while striking out four to move to 4-0 overall, 2-0 against Newington from Legend’s Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s the best game he’s pitched all year, without a doubt” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Cruz. “I think he was under fifty pitches in the fifth inning. He was just pounding the zone and I think he missed [just] a few pitches. I think his [only] walk was in the sixth inning.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the day tied with Meriden (11-4) for first place in the zone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams put together two-out rallies in the first frame, but it was Bristol that came away with a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington’s John Pyne (2-of-3) belted a double to right and when Joe Coleman dropped a single into left, Trevor Nohilly quickly picked up the ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Coleman tried to score from third, the clever Nohilly gunned the runner down as Zach Rinkavage made the catch at the plate and applied a quick tag to end the stanza for the ‘away’ team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We played good defense,” said LaPenta. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the first inning, Andrew Lozier slammed a ball into deep right as he came away with a two-out double.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He advanced to third on an infield hit by Fradette that saw the ball bounce off and away from the pitcher.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Newington fell for the vaunted ‘Bristol pickle.’&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With runners on the corners, Fradette broke from first base but refused to take second – instead heading back to first, baiting a throw.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Newington defense tried to get Fradette but then fired the ball back to third base as Lozier slid into the bag off a retreat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball was thrown well past the bag, rolling all the way to the fence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier easily scored on the miscue as Bristol wrangled up a 1-0 edge through one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz kept Newington off the scoreboard with his deliberate delivery from the hill while counterpart Sam Dionne (six hits, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 Ks) was hanging in on the flip side.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone in the bottom of the third and Bristol still up by a run, Austin Brown (2-for-3, run) drilled a ball towards third base, but the throw was off as the runner arrived safely at first.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown then stole second and took third when Dionne was charged with a balk.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off an Adam Caron grounder, Brown attempted to score from third but was tagged at the dish for the second out of the stanza.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron then swiped second but was picked off to end the inning as Post 2 still led it, 1-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz had retired nine straight going into the bottom of the fourth while Jack Kozikowski (2-for-2, RBI) slipped in a two-out single by the third baseman to get something going.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evan Bouchard grounded a ball towards third base, dying in the thick grass as it rolled into oblivion, and was thrown way over the bag at first.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Kozikowski attempted to score off the error, he was easily tagged out at home plate as the 1-0 score carried into the fifth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz continued to press the issue, sending down 12 straight before walking leadoff batter Nick Dicioccio to open the sixth – the only base-on-balls he allowed that afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Roberto just pitched great,” said LaPenta.  <br></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the walk, Jesus Cintron struck out, Ryan Saindon flew out to Fradette in center while Dan Crouse’s fly-ball to right was quickly snared as Bristol’s 1-0 lead was holding pat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Bristol added two runs to the till in the bottom of the sixth to extend the lead to three.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Obviously, to score two runs in the bottom of the sixth is huge because you know they’re going to do something in the seventh,” said LaPenta. “There’s going to be a little pressure, but when you have a cushion like that, it took [the pressure] off.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown opened the bottom of the sixth with a clean bunt towards third base that died in the shaggy grass, taking second via steal to get into scoring position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A passed ball saw Brown go to third before Caron put the ball in play – a grounder that was streamlined towards third base.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third baseman never made a clean scoop as the ball zipped into left field, allowing Brown to score, as the insurance tally made it a 2-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron then stole second and advanced to third on a Fradette groundout with two gone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Kozikowski dropped in a deep infield hit to third to score Caron and at 3-0, Post 2 was three outs away from ending the event.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Jack had a huge two-out hit,” said LaPenta of Kozikowski. “It was a huge hit to get that third run.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pyne opened the seventh with a single to right, but pinch-hitter Kevin Mooney struck out while a fielder’s choice erased the lead runner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a grounder up the middle by Nick Cox, Bouchard made one heck of a grab in the vicinity of second base and nearly turned it into a game-ending play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the ball was just thrown away at first, both base-runners advanced, and with men on second and third, Sean Hurley represented the tying-run at the dish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I really wanted to see Evan make that play” to end the game said LaPenta. “I would have been a great play.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hurley flipped a ball into right for an RBI base hit to chop the deficit to 3-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Dicioccio popped out to short to end the showdown as Bristol won it by two runs, moving to 11-4 in Zone 1 play to stay on top of the division.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought for having eight days off and playing as hard as we did the last two days was awesome,” said LaPenta of the Berlin and Newington victories.&nbsp;</p>
