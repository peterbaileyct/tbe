<p>The Bristol Eastern boys basketball team is ready for the condensed 2021 campaign and takes a group of seniors into hardwood battle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Elijah Parent is looking to build upon a historic junior season and expect the shooting guard to rack up his points from all areas of the court.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a pretty good 3-point shooter, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is ‘senior heavy’ according to head coach Bunty Ray and expect that group to have this squad at .500, or even a little better, if everything works out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple transfers will also help the Lancers’ cause but, even with an extremely local slate of games, the program is expecting a battle every night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium (Lancer Dome) is the place and here’s what to expect from the boys over at Eastern this year:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN BOYS BASKETBALL</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Bunty Ray (5th season)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record</strong>: 6-14 (Did not qualify for the Division 4 Tournament).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In four seasons at Eastern, Ray is 23-57 overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Subtractions</strong>: Bryce Curtin (forward), Drew Fries (forward), Jordyn Tate (guard/forward), Elijah Borgelin (guard).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Probable Starters</strong>: Elijah Parent (sr, guard), Trini Otero (sr, forward), Josh Kolano (sr, forward), Dylan Woodsome (sr, forward), Nasir Walker (jr, guard).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Players</strong>: Ty Donohue (sr, forward), Jack Stavens (sr, forward), Trevor Nohilly (sr, guard), Alex Fernandez (sr, guard), Nate Fries (so, guard).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Guard play, shooting&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Depth, chemistry&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Eastern will be successful</strong>:&nbsp;If the Lancers can generate some early season chemistry on the court, the team will have good chance for success in 2021. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>Elijah Parent is on the verge of setting a new school record in three-pointers made, despite the shortened season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Not So Fun Fact: </strong>No matter how well the squad does, there won’t be any state tournament to play in this year and this squad really wanted a shot at the postseason in 2021.</p>
