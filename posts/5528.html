<p>MERIDEN - The winning streak for the Bristol Central softball squad continued on Friday night as the Rams were able to knock off Maloney on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central earned a 7-5 win from the Dunn Sports Complex in Meriden, zipping up victory number 10 in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the fourth straight win for the Rams (10-4).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It was a] total team win with offensive contributions [and] defensive efforts from Leah Sklenka, Brooke Soucy, and Janessa Bartell,” said Central coach Monica Hayes via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the seventh inning, Central surged in front as Kaley Laird nabbed a big single and later scored on a Gwen Torreso three-base hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso had a tremendous evening from the plate - going 3-of-4 overall with two triples, two scored runs, and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the circle, Sophia Torreso earned the victory in the end, shutting down the Maloney offense late in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Alex Sciarretto went 1-of-3 from the dish while Lorelei Stancavage “caught a fantastic game” according to Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stancavage was 2-for-4, blasting out a triple and scooping up an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has an extremely busy week coming up - with all three games commencing on the road.</p>
