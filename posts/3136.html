<p>Last Saturday afternoon, I took my family out for a little treat.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During COVID-19, doing something special for my two favorite redheads, Danielle and my main man Asa, isn’t always in the cards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that Saturday was a bit different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We headed up Interstate 91 to a little city called Springfield in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just minutes after crossing over the Connecticut state border, my three year old started to chant ‘basketball, basketball!’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the first time, Asa got a glimpse of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame building.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we got closer to the facility, my son was astonished that the building was shaped like a basketball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, full disclosure, I didn’t go to Springfield for the HOF.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alas, it was a food-driven affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I promised my wife a little UNO Pizzeria &amp; Grill - something you can’t get in Connecticut anymore - which is at the end of the HOF parking lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We bought a couple appetizers and a chocolate cookie sundae for dessert as we dined in front of the HOF, away from people and the like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s nothing wrong tailgating outside the home of basketball legends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was a boy scout with Troop 29, then based out of Northeast Middle School, the Basketball HOF was our usual October trip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve always been a huge basketball fan and that trip was always a special one to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Troop 29 made a pretty nice day of it: The Basketball HOF in the morning and early afternoon, lunch at Burger King (I don’t know why that’s important) and a trip to the former Indian Motorcycle Museum on Hendee Street in Springfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the highlight was always the Basketball HOF and even during COVID-19, it’s a place I’d consider visiting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it appears making a trip to the HOF during these strange times is as safe as going to the market or store down the street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply put, the Naismith Memorial Basketball HOF isn’t fooling around during COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Hall of Fame is focused and committed to providing a safe, clean and healthy environment for all museum guests and staff,” according to the Naismith Memorial Basketball HOF website.&nbsp;“As we continue to monitor the pandemic on an hourly basis, we have, and will continue to, meet with leaders in the government, attraction industry and various experts.&nbsp; We are fully committed to not only abiding by, but exceeding&nbsp;the phased roll out and safety protocols that have been put in place throughout the state of Massachusetts.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, there’s a whole list the "CLEAN TEAM" there has to complete to keep guests safe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means hourly sanitizing of all major touch points including handrails, door knobs, counter tops, bathroom faucets, elevator buttons and other highly touched surfaces</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Complimentary disposable face masks for all guests and new hand sanitizer stations spread prominently throughout the museum continue to add another layer of safety to the facility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology plays a part which includes electrostatic disinfectant air mist backpack system, hands free soap and paper towel dispensers being installed in all restrooms and a new HEPA floor cleaning equipment for all carpeted surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are we on the Starship Enterprise with all this technology? No, it’s just the Naismith Memorial Basketball HOF.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s even a new laundry facility on site for cleaning and disinfecting&nbsp;sanitation materials daily (they have to keep NBA Hall of Famer, and former Boston Celtics’ star Kevin McHale’s wool underwear exhibit as clean as possible).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s all the things you’d expect in a public building during COVID-19 like designated foot traffic patterns to facilitate social distancing, way finding signage to eliminate congestion and cross patterns of traffic and social distancing reminders spread throughout museum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the facility sanitizes every basketball following guest use (there’s a huge gymnasium where you can, of course, shoot hoops at the HOF).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all the interactive games, stories and videos to watch, I was curious how the HOF was handling those exhibits - meaning multiple touch screens to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s all under control as all guests at the HOF receives a complimentary stylus device to use on all touch screen applications throughout the museum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look, we can all hunker down in our homes, bar the windows, and turn on Netflix for another epic adventure with Borat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, you and your family can still do that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if you’re safe, wear your mask, and take precautions, there’s a special basketball Hall of Fame about 45 minutes away from Bristol that would make one heck of a day trip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I highly recommend it, even if you just want to experience the Kevin McHale underwear exhibit.</p>
