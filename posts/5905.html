<p>WEST HARTFORD - It’s the 93rd year of Bristol American Legion baseball and after a season in the CT Elite Baseball Association in 2020 due to the pandemic, it’s business as usual for Post 2 this summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And between the two public high schools in the city, as well as several collegiate players in the mix, Bristol is expected to have a very good season in the revamped Zone 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think we have a pretty solid team,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “The pitching staff is going to be pretty good.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s rotation on the hill will always keep the locals in the game and if the hitting can come around - something the returning Austin Brown will help with at the leadoff position - Post 2 is going to be in every game this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitching is certainly a strength because Bristol Central’s Mike Lorenzetti joined the program and is an imposing force on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern’s Andrew Lozier was tremendous over the second half of the Lancers’ season - earning Class L All-State honors along the way - and should see some starts over the summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier adds depth and ability around the infield as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Albert Molina, a 2020 graduate of Terryville high school, is a solid lefty for the Bristol pitching line-up and it was fantastic to see Bristol Eastern’s Alex Canzellarini playing summer ball - getting a chance to pitch after his injury this past spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Matt Beaucar will start games for Post 2 while teammate Adam Caron (first base), Roberto Cruz (infield), along with Eastern’s Tyler Martin (infield) and Dylan Woodsome (outfield) can provide relief on the mound at an instance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even Eastern’s Trevor Nohilly can toss an inning or two when not playing in right field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s those returning collegiate players that also will give the line-up some pop including UHART’s Evan Bouchard (shortstop), Paul Smith’s Jack Kozikowski (outfield, third base), University of Bridgeport’s Zack Rinkavage (third base, short), Lincoln’s Spencer Lindroth (infield), along with Brown (Nichols College, outfield).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ryan Fradette has a stick and will track down any ball hit to centerfield, Nate Ouellette can catch and play all around the infield, as will Tyler Stickels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I like our depth,” said LaPenta. “We’ve got a lot of talented players.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 1 is certainly stacked this season with the likes of Avon, Berlin, Meriden, Newington, and West Hartford in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what will Naugatuck, one of many new teams to Zone 1 this season, bring to the table?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s that unknown that should make the zone a fun one to watch as the season unfolds of the next couple months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol just needs a little added chemistry and once Post 2 can put the entire package together, the locals will have plenty of trips to the pay window before the postseason commences at the end of July.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think we’ll have a good summer,” said LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…Reports surfaced this past week that the Southington American Legion baseball program has folded in a shocking development…Originally, Bristol had twenty-four Zone 1 games on its docket this year. With Southington dropping out, that number fell to twenty-one Zone 1 contests for all the teams.</p>
