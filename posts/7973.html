<p>Before the Bristol Board of Education monthly meeting and upset with the mask mandate in Bristol Public Schools, about 20 protestors, including men, women, and children, stood on the sidewalk outside the Board of Education Building on Church Street, Wednesday just before the sunset.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a revolutionary war drummer tapped put duty calls on his snare drum, and with American flags waving and noisemakers filling the air, a man armed with a bullhorn called for the resignation of BOE president Jen Dube; with catcalls of “Jennifer Dube resign you are a disgrace to Bristol!”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, inside, board members made small talk and last-minute preparations for the meeting, unaffected by the showings outside.</p>

<p>The meeting was called to order at approximately 7:02.  As the board members soldiered through their agenda, the 800-pound gorilla in the room was the protestors.&nbsp; Would they arrive, and would there be a disturbance?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, they did arrive, taking up the limited but remaining seats while wearing masks. </p>

<p>The public participation occurred near the conclusion of the meeting. Jennifer Dube read emails the BOE received from concerned parents into the record, including students who reported experiencing headaches, sweating, and difficulties breathing in school due to the masks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the emails, six protesters addressed the Board, all being critical of the school mask policy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the speakers was Kristen Bevins.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms. Bevins, showing photos, advised the Board know that many of her children’s teachers do not wear masks during class.&nbsp; She objected to what she felt was the hypocrisy of students required to wear masks at all times in class, while teachers and administrators did not.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another speaker was David Ragali who spoke passionately without the benefit of prepared remarks.&nbsp; Mr. Ragali captured the sentiment and theme that&nbsp;was voiced by many of the speakers regarding the inconsistencies of masks in schools, “If you’re going to tell my child to wear a mask, I’m going to tell you tenfold that everybody around my child better have a mask on, always!”</p>
