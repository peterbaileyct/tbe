Regarding the ballot questions, for both state and local elections this Nov. 6, the best I can do is share some of the material that is available publicly.

First, here is a summary provided by the state of the questions: <a href="http://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot1.pdf">Ballot questions for State of Connecticut and Bristol</a>.

Second, here is the <a href="http://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/draftreport.pdf">draft report</a> from the 2018 Charter Revision Commission, addressing local questions.

Third, here is some specific information for Question 5: Shall sewage disposal be removed as a responsibility of the director of public works and transferred to the water department?
