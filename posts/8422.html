<p>It is not commonly known, but one-in-five teens struggle to afford period products and have missed a day of school due to that. And 46 percent of low-income women have had to choose between buying period products or a meal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To help fight period poverty in the communities of Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington and Wolcott, the Main Street Community Foundation’s Women &amp; Girls’ Fund organized a collection of feminine hygiene products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Items&nbsp;were collected before the Fund’s annual Wonder of Women (WOW) event through a dropbox at the Foundation’s office and an Amazon Wish List; attendees to the WOW event also brought items that evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We wanted to do even more to help local women and girls,” said Jeanine Audette, co-Chair of the WOW event.&nbsp;“These necessary products are not covered by WIC and SNAP benefits, and schools do not always have access to extra products, especially ones that may fit teen girls.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The feminine hygiene products&nbsp;were&nbsp;distributed to&nbsp;schools, shelters and human service agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Dozens and dozens of people donated hundreds of items, and we are so thankful,” stated Audette.</p>
