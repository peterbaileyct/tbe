<p>The Bristol Central girls basketball team is back in CCC Region B action tonight, taking on New Britain in an extremely rare appearance as this strange scholastic season continues to unfold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The schools are not usual opponents as the Golden Hurricanes broke off from the CCC South division several years ago and crossover games don’t happen too often between the programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a tough task against New Britain but the Rams are home for that confrontation in the friendly confines of the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if the Rams can play a little defense and get all of its scoring on the same page tonight, Central has a chance to get to the pay window for the first time this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at what to expect in the Rams’ showdown on Tuesday evening:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central (0-3) vs. New Britain (1-3)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time –&nbsp;</strong>5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong>&nbsp;– Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium, Bristol Central</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The question – </strong>Can Central’s defense slow down a very athletic squad from New Britain?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is looking for a little more consistency on offense and certainly has the players to put some points on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso (8.3 points-per-game) is due for a breakout scoring game and why can’t that happen against the Golden Hurricanes?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Bartell (9.3 ppg) will also produce for the Rams as will Brooke and Ella Watson along with veteran Gwen Torreso.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These players just need to get its offense to flow with a bit more consistency and if the program can combine to score 50 points, instead of its average of 38.3 ppg, the locals have a chance in this one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the Rams allowed just 54 and 51 points in losses to Lewis Mills and Southington and, at the very least, needs to keep the Golden Hurricanes around or under that number of points to stay competitive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain’s Maya Slisz (15.8 points-per-game over her first four games) is a handful on the court and capable of a 20-point outing on any given night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams can contain her, along with a couple other athletic components on the hardwood, victory number one might be on the horizon for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like the boys, the Central girls are playing three times this week which includes two winnable games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games on the horizon for Central:&nbsp;</strong>Bristol Central at Lewis Mills (Friday, February 26, 5:30 p.m.); Central vs. Plainville (Saturday, February 27, 3 p.m.).</p>
