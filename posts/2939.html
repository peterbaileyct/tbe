<p>The Bristol Eastern Lady Lancers evened their season record with a convincing 3-0 win over Plainville on Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The standout performance was by Emily Nelson, who dominated play all game. She set up the first goal when she penetrated the defense and played a beautiful cross to the far post where Breanna Venturo Nelson was waiting. Venturo Nelson corralled&nbsp;the ball and finished for the early lead midway through the first half.&nbsp;<br>Nelson was right back at it 10 minutes later, as she finished off one of numerous breakaways on the day. The 2-0 Lancer lead held until halftime. </p>

<p>At the break, BE held a 7-2 shot on goal advantage over Plainville. Eastern goalie Grace D'Amato (6 saves) was up to the task all afternoon, blanking the Blue Devils and eventually earning her first shutout of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emily Nelson was not done scoring for Eastern as she pierced the net just three minutes into the second half. Despite numerous opportunities&nbsp;for her to earn a hat trick, and for others to chip in on the scoring, the Eastern total stayed at 3.</p>

<p> Plainville never stopped fighting and held the Lancers scoreless for the final 37 minutes. Amber St. Onge was stellar in goal for Plainville despite constantly being tested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Defensively, the Lancers were anchored&nbsp;by D'Amato in goal and a back line consisting of Cecelia Gilbert, Kate Kozikowski, Audra Porowski, Mikayla Gonzalez, and Maura Cyr.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tuesday was also senior day for BE, as they recognized Kate Kozikowski, Annabella Lusitani, and Lili Morneault. All three have left a lasting and positive impact on the program that will be felt for years to come.<br></p>
