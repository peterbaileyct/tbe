<p>Come Sunday morning, I will have tried to sleep in but will only succeed in sleeping a little more than usual because that is the way things are now—maybe getting older does that, maybe it’s something else. Maybe it’s not wanting to fall behind—a futile effort if ever there was one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is just so much going on all the time. Granted, we are inundated with information that is always being pushed out by one venue or another. The problem with that, being inundated, is that it does not allow time to figure out what is what, what it means, what its significance, how it fits into a larger picture.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just something to think about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, the Chauvin verdict was announced. The former Minneapolis police officer was guilty on all three counts in the murder of George Floyd. What this will mean in the larger scheme of things will become apparent over time, but I know where I was when the verdict was announced—in my kitchen, waiting, breathless, as I listened to the radio account of the judge returning to the courtroom and receiving the word from the jury and reading the verdict out loud, thanking the jurors for their service, providing final instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It wasn’t two seconds before the texts&nbsp;starting flying&nbsp;on the family stream: “Guilty on all charges,” “And bail revoked.” Then a phone call from a friend, and a long conversation. And afterwards, listening to more reporting. And finally, turning off the radio and a moment of quiet, just quiet to let the information sink in. Sunday morning the information is still sinking in, and I am guessing it will for&nbsp;a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The week will start and end with Parts 2 and 3 of the Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s documentary, “Hemingway.” It’s good work, coming from me that doesn’t mean much, I am no authority on&nbsp;documentaries, but it is good work, and the story about one of our great American novelists is captivating and sad,&nbsp;and in some ways, illuminating, while in others, mystifying. Which, I suppose, when it comes to a person’s life, is the way it should be.&nbsp;Hemingway did what he could with what he was handed, which is a testament to his spirit, and he did this despite some serious flaws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same week, Finland will again find itself, for the fourth time, the country with the happiest people, on average, of all the places on earth to live. This is according to the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network’s annual report. The information has been available for a month, but I only came across it this week. The&nbsp;<a href="https://worldhappiness.report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Happiness Report</a>&nbsp;is based on interviews with 350,000 people from 95 countries and its results are ranked on how interviewees rate their happiness on a 10-point scale.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, what fosters happiness? The answer may be somewhat mysterious, but it is much less mysterious after reading about Finland and how it functions—at the sake of being somewhat mysterious myself, I will leave conclusions up to those people curious enough to read the report themselves. I don’t think there will be much surprise as recognition of those things we all value and how they are addressed in that country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, on Saturday there was another visit, with Mary, to see one of the grandkids. It’s a nice way to center, spending time with a 16-month-old, whose focus is immediate, whose concerns are limited to the moment, and&nbsp;whose satisfaction is determined by how close mom and dad are;&nbsp;how quickly the water cup is refilled and just as quickly who is there to sweep her up in their arms for comfort and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until next week!&nbsp;</p>
