<p>The Connecticut Twilight Baseball League is running its annual postseason tournament and the Bristol Knights -- the four time league champs -- already passed its first round test last Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In first round play of the double elimination tournament, the fourth-seeded Knights picked off No. 5 Rock Cats by a 9-3 final from Riverfront Park in Glastonbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The postseason is typically when the Knights shine, and with the victory, the squad continues the postseason with another tournament game on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it will be another huge showdown as Bristol battles No. 1 Rocky Hill at 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All tournament games commence from Riverfront Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A win by the Knights would keep the program in the winner’s bracket with another game on Thursday at 8 p.m. while a loss to the Rockies put Bristol in an elimination showdown on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Rocky Hill, Elmer’s Angels were the regular season runner-up in CTL play this season while the Fat Orange Cat Brewers came in third place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CTL, established in 1989, has been the home of the Bristol Knights since 2003.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team won the league championship in 2007 and 2011, and were back-to-back champs in 2014 and 2015.</p>
