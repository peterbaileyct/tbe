<p>Over the years, the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame has done a tremendous job honoring the numerous individual and sports teams in the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to its website (<a href="http://bshof.org"><strong>bshof.org</strong></a>), the mission of the program is ‘to permanently honor, document and preserve distinctive contributions and achievements to the sports heritage of Bristol.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the best of the best from Bristol has been inducted to the BSHOF and the program continues to do so to this day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That includes Adrian Muzzy who was part honored as part of the 2005 BSHOF class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Muzzy was the outstanding gentleman who gave the city of Bristol the piece of land that became Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this week, with all the baseball that was played from that venue every summer, it’s important to learn a little something about the Mr. Muzzy and the venue he helped create.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Straight from the BSHOF website:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Adrian Muzzy was a local businessman who donated the property we now know as Muzzy Field to the Public Welfare Association in Bristol in 1912.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Public Welfare Association, in turn, gave the land to the City of Bristol which turned it into one of New England’s most historic and beautiful ball parks. Babe Ruth played at the park twice and was the first to hit a home run over the fence in a game, an exhibition in 1919 when he was playing for the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A number of other well-known sports figures have played on the field, including the great NFL coach Vince Lombardi and baseball hall of famers Pie Traynor, Lloyd Waner, Honus Wagner, Wade Boggs, Ryne Sandberg and Gary Carter as well as thousands of local athletes in a variety of sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muzzy donated the property in memory of two sons who died at very young ages. Those who have played on the field will tell you it’s an honor because of those who played on it before them. Adrian Muzzy’s gift has long been and will continue to be one of Bristol’s greatest treasures.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the new press box at Muzzy Field, a plague with that exact inscription is on the back wall - honoring Mr. Muzzy and his contribution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a fitting tribute to Adrian Muzzy and that amazing gift to the city that thousands of athletes and spectators enjoy each and every year.</p>
