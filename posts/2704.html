<p>The CIAC football committee voted to recommend pushing the high school football season to the spring because of concerns over Covid 19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The football committee does not have power to change the season, but their recommendation will be considered by the CIAC Board of Control in their meeting this Wednesday. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The football committee includes athletic directors, school administrators, and several coaches from across the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From my own observations, the decision will not be an easy one, as many high school football coaches and athletes have expressed a desire to play this fall.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Board of Control would also have to consider the impact on the spring sports season, as many football players would normally participate in a spring sport.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just last week, the CIAC announced an amended fall schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first day of full team practice was set for Sept. 11, and the first contests of the season could begin on Sept. 24. The last day for regular season contests was set for Oct. 30. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first two weeks of November were planned as a "tournament experience" for all teams, the format for which was to be decided upon at a later time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the fall schedule changes were announced last week, CIAC executive director Glenn Lungarini stressed that all decisions were fluid and subject to change at any time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All other fall sports committees are also meeting this week, but no decisions on other recommendations have emerged as of yet.</p>
