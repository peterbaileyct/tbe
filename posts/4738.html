<p>BRISTOL – The standings in the Central Connecticut Conference Region B girls basketball have become awfully crowded as of late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s thanks in part to the squad over at Bristol Eastern starting to heat up a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in order to stay in the race for first place, the Lancers had to defeat longtime rival, Region B division leader Southington on Monday, March 8 in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with Eastern’s 55-37 victory over the Knights that evening, the Lancers are on top of the division – along with three other foes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington, Plainville, Farmington and Eastern are all now 7-2 as each squad has three games left to play in the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since losing to Southington back on February 20, the Lancers have won four out of its last five games and are looking to win out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be interesting as the Lancers finish the campaign with road dates at Lewis Mills and New Britain – teams Eastern has already toppled in Bristol this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the Central Connecticut Conference Tournament looming, every win counts in large amounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every squad in the CCC will be invited to the tourney but the top eight squads get the right to play for the CCC championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a goal the Lancers are shooting for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of Region B, which squad has the advantage over the final three games in the race for first place?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give the nod to Bristol Eastern in that category.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the schedules for all four teams as Eastern races to the finish:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern</strong> – vs. Bristol Central (3/11), at Lewis Mills (3/15), at New Britain (3/18).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of Note – </strong>The Lancers are 3-0 against the back end of their schedule, winning those three contests by an average of 21.3 points-per-game. None of those final three games are against the division leaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Southington</strong> – vs. Plainville (3/11), vs. Avon (3/15), at Farmington (3/18).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of Note – </strong>The Knights are 2-1 against the remainder of the schedule with that Farmington game looming to end the regular season on the road. Southington lost to Plainville at the buzzer (48-47) back on February 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Plainville</strong> – at Southington (3/11), vs. Farmington (3/15), at Avon (3/18).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of Note – </strong>This might be the toughest schedule out of the lot as the Blue Devils have to play both Southington and Farmington. Plainville is 2-1 this year against that competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Farmington</strong> – at Avon (3/11), at Plainville (3/15), vs. Southington (3/18).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of Note – </strong>The Farmington girls basketball team is 2-1 against that schedule, falling to Southington on February 26 by a 45-40 final. Do you think Farmington will be ready for that encounter against the Knights?</p>
