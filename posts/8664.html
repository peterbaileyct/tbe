<p>The Mayor’s Office, United Way, and&nbsp;FoodShare&nbsp;are offering additional rounds of the Farmers to Families Produce Box Distribution program. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two events are scheduled for&nbsp;<strong>Thursday, October 21</strong>.&nbsp;Distribution will take place from 4 p.m to 6:30 p.m. or until the boxes run out at the Bristol Department of Public Works Garage at 95 Vincent P. Kelly Road.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>“The last box contained cantaloupe, cabbage, sweet potatoes, carrots, eggplant and Idaho potatoes,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “It is an almost 25 pound box of produce that is a nice addition to a household. And, if it is too much for one person, we encourage people to share with family members and neighbors.”</p>

<p><br>“We are receiving approximately 1,000 boxes on&nbsp;October 21st,” said Donna Osuch, President of the United Way. “We know that food insecurity continues to be an issue for some and we are really happy that this program was extended again.”</p>

<p>The pallets of food boxes will be unloaded from the trucks and divided with volunteers at each station. The line of cars will be directed into drive-thru lines where the food will be placed into the back seat or trunk of each vehicle.
