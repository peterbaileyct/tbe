<p>There is still an opportunity for early risers to catch a peak of the  International Space Station (ISS) flying over Bristol before daybreak the during next couple of days. (See the chart below.)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to NASA, Tuesday, Nov. 10 through Thursday, Nov. 12, the ISS will flyover between 4 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., depending on the day. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ISS will be the light streaking across the sky, which will be the sun’s reflection. It will be silent, move faster than an airplane, and there will not be any red and green navigation lights.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not uncommon for the ISS to fly over Bristol, but this will be the best opportunity to see it in the coming days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The space station will be about 240 miles above the earth and moving 5 miles per second.</p>
