<p>Despite social distancing restrictions, pleas from government (city officials)<strong> </strong>leaders, yellow caution tape and signs on the fences at Riley Field, which display messages like “Closed Until Further Notice”, pick-up basketball games at the park<strong> </strong>continued during the current COVID-19 health crisis,<em> </em>until this week. </p>

<p>Over the course of the last few weeks while residents began to feel relaxed and the weather improved, it was not uncommon to drive-by the park on Shrub Rd. and see someone knocking down a three from behind the arc during a three-on-three or a two-on-two or even a shoot around at the park.</p>

<p>Late last week, to keep the populace safe and restore order to the Mum, the hoops were taken down.  In response, the court and its general surroundings were littered with plastic bottles of Aquafina, Gatorade, Powerade, Poland Springs, Dunkin Donuts, et al – take your pick.  The baseball field and tennis court went unblemished. </p>
