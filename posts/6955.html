<p>SOUTH WINDSOR -- It was an all-Zone 1 Northern semifinal on Thursday in game one of the Connecticut American Legion Baseball Tournament from Rotary Field in South Windsor as No. 3 Bristol and No. 7 Avon were locked in mortal combat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the contest, a scoreless affair going into final inning, was grafting out to where the first team to score was going to win the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon turned that into reality in the top of the seventh as Matt Leopold -- the game-winning pitcher&nbsp; -- dropped in a two-out single to score Christian Boudreau as Post 201 defeated Bristol 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are always going to be tight," said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of state tournament games. “Matty [Beaucar] pitched a great game, [Leopold] pitched a great game. It was just going to come down to one little [play].”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon (15-7) moved on to the Northern final against Middletown Friday while Bristol ended the campaign at 19-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Matt Beaucar was simply tremendous, throwing a one-run, two-hitter that included two Ks and was unhittable midway through the affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leopold was nearly as brilliant, allowing two hits, striking out four and walked just one over a complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 201 had chances to score throughout the showdown, but Beaucar and the Bristol defense simply wouldn’t allow it until late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in that fateful seventh inning, Christian Boudreau opened the frame with a full-count walk as LaPenta gathered his troops on the mound to set up a defensive plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emmett Borenstein flew out to right for the first out as a hit-and-run opportunity came and went for Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boudreau was nearly doubled off as the throw in from right field by Austin Brown was just offline to first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the runner stole second to get into scoring position for Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danny Bae, also playing a tough defensive third base that day, flew out to left for the second out and Beaucar was one strike away from getting out of the jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Leopold dropped a single to the gap in right -- plating Boudreau -- as Post 201 took a 1-0 lead into the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol did not respond as Avon moved on to square off against Middletown Friday for a chance to play for the state title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had the guy doubled-up at first,” said LaPenta. “Austin just made an offline throw. You get that, it was an easy double play [with] two outs and nobody on. Now we come up in the seventh with a chance to win it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first frame, Avon’s Max Raha walked with one out, stole second, took third on a passed ball but the visitors did not score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was sent down in order in the bottom of the tilt while Beaucar returned the favor in the top of the second as the showdown was a scoreless affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the third, big Nick Amatulia was plunked by a pitch from Beaucar and advanced to second on a groundout from Tyler Nyberg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then when Tyler Bonney singled by the bag at first, runners were on the corners with one away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bonney was gunned down trying to steal second off a slick throw by catcher Owen Davis and Raha lined out to Trevor Nohilly in left to send Avon packing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the third, Nohilly cracked the no-hitter with a base hit to right as Post 2 had something brewing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then stole second on a 1-1 pitch, but Brown grounded out to Amatulia at first base to end the third frame of a 0-0 stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 201 couldn’t figure out Beaucar through four while Bristol cracked Leopold a bit in the bottom of the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one down, Andrew Lozier drew a full-count walk and then a Texas Leaguer by Ryan Fradette to short centerfield put two runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Kozikowski also drew a full count but struck out, as did Davis, to close out the fourth without the benefit of a score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar retied seven straight going into the bottom of the fifth as he allowed just the one hit to Bonney.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leopold held the fort as well, allowing just two hits through five frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zack Rinkavage did an amazing job at third base for Bristol, stabbing at a Tyler Nyberg grounder and throwing him out via a one-hopper to first to open the top of the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a K of Bonney and a groundout by Raha, Beaucar had sat down 10 consecutive batters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the top of the order for Bristol in the bottom of the sixth but Leopold retired the side in order -- throwing just six pitches -- as the seventh inning was upon the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the seventh, with Boudreau on second base and two outs, Leopold drove an 0-2 pitch into right-centerfield to notch the go-ahead RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The 0-2 pitch, I’ll not going to blame Matty because he pitched a great game,” said LaPenta. “It just leaped back over the plate and [Leopold] stuck it and just happened to hit it where nobody was. It wasn’t a great hit. It was just kind of a desperation thing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But you’re not going to win if you don’t score.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol wouldn’t yield even as Avon went up 1-0, the locals nearly tied the game up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette started the bottom of the seventh with a walk to put the tying runner on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan Woodsome pinch hit for Jack Kozikowski, dropped down a two-strike bunt and on the sacrifice, Fradette took second base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 had two chances to drive in the tying run but Davis struck out while Fradette took third base on a passed ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evan Bouchard drew a full count but off one final groundout, Avon survived and advanced, 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had our chances,” said LaPenta. “We had a guy on second base with one out and we had a chance to get him in and we didn’t do it. But I’m still really proud of the guys. They played hard.”</p>
