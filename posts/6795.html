<p>The Bristol American Legion junior baseball team has done a credible job turning its season around off a rough start, now standing at 6-7 overall – winners of two straight games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dropping a tough 3-2 decision to Newington on July 7, Post 2 has won five of its last six games with just a forfeit to West Hartford as the only loss on Bristol’s docket over that stretch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>July 11 saw the locals scoop up a 6-2 victory against Simsbury and then three days later, Post 2 was a huge 5-4 victor over West Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following day, on July 15, Bristol belted Torrington by a 15-2 final but ended up forfeiting its contest at West Hartford on July 21.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington was on the docket this past Saturday with Bristol scooping up a 3-2 triumph from Riley Field that saw Post 2’s Michael Roalf win the game, going three strong innings in relief of starter Ryan Maglio.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf threw 43 pitches to seize the program’s fifth victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Monday, Bristol zipped out to an early lead and hung on to knock off Simsbury, 8-6, from Riley Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 tallied eight hits and led 2-1 after one frame before putting some distance between the squads.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A four-run second stanza, coupled with a solitary run in the fourth, made it a 7-1 game that Bristol eventually held on to win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill won the contest on the hill, going 4.1 innings over a 60-pitch stint.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jose Feliciano belted a home run, his first of the season, to lead the Bristol offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 out-hit Simsbury 8-5.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Streak&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol started the campaign at 1-6 before catching fire recently.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the last three losses for the locals were via that forfeit and two one-run defeats – showing that Post 2 was right in the mix, looking to breakout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Looking to Break .500&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has a chance to finish the regular season at .500 or better as the locals have five games in to play, starting on Wednesday with a doubleheader from Riley Park.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 has a back-to-back challenge against Newington today with the games commencing at 4:45 and 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, Post 2 travels to Simsbury for a showdown from Town Forest (5:30 p.m.) and finally on Saturday, it’s a double-dip from Riley Field in Bristol</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington comes to town for two Zone 1 contests. Game time for game one is set for 2 p.m. with the rematch to follow around 4:15 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 3-2 finish by the program would see the locals draw even on the year.&nbsp;</p>
