<p>BRISTOL - The Fall Postseason Experience is finally here for the scholastic sports programs in Bristol and the Central Connecticut Conference has set up an array of contests that will involve all four regions this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the phrase ‘Fall Postseason Experience’ sounds as exciting as saying ‘Washington Football Team’ or ‘cod liver oil,’ the CCC has allowed its teams to play a couple of playoff games that could end up becoming city series entanglements in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC has split most regions into upper and lower brackets - seeding teams 1-8 according to winning percentage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All games take place within the regional format and most of the squads from the Mum City are in the top tiers in terms of competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All contests will commence from the home field of the higher seed unless otherwise noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In boys soccer, the upper portion of the Region B bracket sees No. 4 Bristol Eastern (4-2-4) squaring off against top ranked Farmington (9-0-1), while No. 3 Bristol Central (4-4-2) travels to Plainville (8-4) to take on the second-rated Blue Devils on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern ended up tying Farmington on November 4 in a 1-1 stalemate. It was the Indians only non-victory of the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central split the season series with Plainville, snapping up an impressive 4-0 shutout over the Blue Devils on November 4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls soccer program at Eastern (5-5-1) is ranked fourth and travels to Southington (12-0),  the number one seed,  on Tuesday starting at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The day before the Lancers play, fifth ranked Bristol Central (4-6-2) is home against winless New Britain (eighth seed, 0-12) on Monday at 2:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell by five goals both times against Southington while Central foiled New Britain twice this season by identical 7-0 scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In volleyball, Bristol Eastern (11-0) attempts to keep its undefeated ledger intact with a home date on Monday against No. 4 Avon (7-4), while second-rated Bristol Central (10-2) will battle No. 3 Farmington (9-3) from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on Tuesday, both matches starting at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of each match will face-off on Thursday, November 12 - according to the CCC website - which could lead to a third and final battle between the Rams and the Lancers in another epic city series showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is 2-0 against Central this year, but both matches were hard fought battles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In swimming and diving, the postseason experience will include four meets by region between November 9-12. Either a virtual or in-person meet with another team from the region will take place during that timeframe.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in boys and girls cross country, the programs from Region B compete in a race on Tuesday from Stanley Quarter Park in New Britain at 3 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of the week, the shortened fall scholastic season comes to a swift completion, with a date for the start of the winter campaign to be determined.</p>
