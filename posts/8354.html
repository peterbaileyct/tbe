<p>FARMINGTON - Bristol Central’s football team won its showdown at Farmington on Friday evening, downing the River Hawks by a 35-29 final on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home team trailed by nearly thirty points during the encounter before making a furious comeback, falling in the end by six as the Rams moved to 3-1 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington (0-4) remains winless in 2021 though it gave Central a run for its money in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s defense held late but offensively, senior sensation Victor Rosa bullied the River Hawks for over 300 yards on the ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a historic tally by Rosa as his 324 rushing yards - leading to five touchdowns - was the tenth highest single-game rushing total in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he needed just 20 carries to tally that amazing yardage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa joins the likes of Garry Pearson, Dathan Hickey, Tyler Burrow, Karl Hall, and Timmy Washington as players who rushed for 300-plus yards in a game for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa’s career-high was just nine yards off the seventh best mark in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in 2017, Hickey raced for 333 yards in Central’s Thanksgiving Day victory over rival Bristol Eastern which is the seventh highest tally for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central is hitting its peak already in 2021</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are truly rolling through the season, winning three straight games, and is firmly in the Class L playoff mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through four games, Central is in the top-10 of the postseason standings and as of Sunday morning, the Rams are tied for tenth place along with&nbsp; Windsor and Masuk of Monroe with 440 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only a 7-6 setback at Bloomfield during Week 1 has kept Central from an undefeated ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rosa’s numbers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s so easy to focus on the UCONN bound Rosa every week but anyone who has watched Central play this year understands that the program is an outstanding overall unit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether it’s a big reception by Damion Glasper, a PAT from Zach Telke, or a huge stop by the Rams’ defensive front line, there’s no denying that the program from Bristol is legit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rosa is the leader of the crew and has been absolutely sensational to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s his rushing totals through just four games:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 1 (at Bloomfield) - </strong>21 carries, 99 yards, TD</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 2 (vs. South Windsor)</strong> - 20 carries, 239 yards, 3 TD’s (1 passing TD)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 3 (vs. Wethersfield) </strong>- 26 carries, 240 yards, 4 TD’s</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 4 (at Farmington)</strong> - 20 carries, career-high 324 yards, 5 TDS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Totals to date</strong>: 87 carries, 902 yards (10.4 yards-per-carry), 13 rushing TDS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa needs less than 100 yards to break 1,000 for the season is on pace for a 2,000 yard campaign. That’s an incredible tally for any athlete on the gridiron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s also six rushing TD’s away from tying his single season career-high of 19 - tied for the 10th highest mark in Central football history.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Next Week…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is back in action this Saturday as the Rams travel to Hartford Public at 1 p.m. in a CCC cross-tier event (or however Dave Greenleaf would frame it…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a perfect start by the Owls, the program lost their last two games as Public (2-2) fell to Tolland by a 39-28 final this past Saturday in Hartford.</p>
