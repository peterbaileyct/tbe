<p>It was just a matter of time before the Bristol Eastern baseball squad was going to hop back into the win column.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that happened on Thursday as the Lancers scored three runs in the bottom of the sixth inning - getting an excellent pitching from Andrew Lozier in the process - as Eastern defeated Platt, 6-4, in a CCC South confrontation from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers improved to 3-12 overall with its chances for a state tournament berth still in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that same vein, Platt fell to 7-9 as the squad can qualify for the postseason against some other opponent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier had a brilliant complete game effort on the hill, allowing just three hits - none of which came after the third inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of the Lozier's runs were unearned while he threw just 34 pitches over the final four innings, facing just one batter over the minimum during that stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was deficit Eastern had to overcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first frame, Plattâ€™s leadoff batter Trent D'Aniello was hit by a pitch and pitcher Ommy Velez doubled to deep left to score the lead runner - making it a 1-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern responded with three runs in the bottom of the first to secure a 3-1 push.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill was hit by Velez's first pitch of the game, Dylan Woodsome then followed with a walk, Lozier singled to right to score Churchill to tie the score at 1-1 - putting runners on first and third.&nbsp; Lozier later stole second and then with two outs, Tyler Stickels singled to left to score Woodsome and Lozier as Eastern scooped up a 3-1 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the top of the third tilt,&nbsp;Platt scored three times to snare a 4-3 edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infield error put leadoff Zack Baker on, two wild pitches advanced him to third, and a base-on-balls to Tucker Sperry put runners on first and third.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baker scored on D'Aniello's sacrifice fly to chop the deficit to 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then a base hit by Matt Merrigan and a run scoring single to center by Velez scored Sperry made it a 3-3 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Baker scored the go-ahead run when the relay throw from Velez's single was thrown away as the Panthers scooped up a 4-3 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern trailed by one going into the bottom of the sixth and that all changed after the home squad scored three times to nab a two-run edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Velez, who had pitched shutout ball since the first inning, walked Ben D'Amato and Stickels to start the sixth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A bunt attempt was popped up for the first out but Cameron Moore tallied the game-winning hit as he doubled down the right field line - scoring pinch runner Elliot Norris and Stickels - to give the Lancers a 5-4 lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two Platt infield errors led to one final run as Eastern was leading 6-4 as Lozier was cruising on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Panthers never scored again - falling by two runs as Eastern continues its postseason push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern will have its hands full on Monday, battling top-ranked East Catholic in a CCC Interdivisional war from Muzzy Field, starting at 3:45 p.m.</p>
