If you do, the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum is offering you one FREE adult admission to the museum when you visit during the month of February,” said Nicastro.<br>“The process is simple. Just pop by the museum any time Wednesday through Sunday from 10:00-5:00, show your work ID to the admission staff, and you will be admitted free of charge.
