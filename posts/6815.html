<p>Before the postseason begins for the Junior American Legion Baseball squads in Connecticut, Bristol had a little work to do to complete its regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four games are on the slate with two big doubleheaders this weekend and coach Bill Mason has his troops ready for the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is currently 7-8 overall entering Saturday after splitting two games against Newington on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol fell in game one by a 6-2 final while the locals picked up a huge 3-2 victory in the nightcap from Riley Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both contests were five inning affairs with the first a make-up due to a rainout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Ryan Maglio threw 43 pitches the previous day against Newington but the contest was not completed due to the weather.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the restart, Bristol turned to Elliot Norris, throwing 2.1 innings of solid ball, but drew the loss as Newington overcame a 2-1 deficit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Down by a run, the visiting outfit scored two runs in the third and three in the fourth to take the showdown in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the immediate rematch, Post 2 got to the pay window over the 3-2 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over another five inning challenge, Norris was called upon again - earning the win in a 15-pitch stint over 1.1 innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a strange scoring quirk, Bristol scored runs in the odd innings while Newington added its runs over the even frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant Bristol won out in the end as Post 2 broke a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the fifth to seal the victory despite just generating two hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for Norris, it was his first win of the season (1-2) as the pitcher had a strange dual decision day, going 1-1 on Thursday against Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Double dips on Saturday and Sunday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad has four big games to finish out its regular season campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while no one can catch Zone 1 champion West Hartford, Post 2 can send the squad into the postseason on a losing note.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All games this weekend commence from Riley Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday’s games see Bristol take on Torrington at 2 and 4:15 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday, the champs are in town - starting at 11 a.m. - as West Hartford invades Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the second contest, Post 2 wraps up the regular season against Simsbury at 1:30 p.m.</p>
