<p>It’s been a tough year for scholastic sports in Connecticut with cancellations, postponements, and limited postseason entanglements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting with the fall campaign, the scholastic season was delayed and there was one point where we were all unsure if sports would ever return in 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all thought football would have its season - played over a five or six game slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were rumors that volleyball was going to be played outside while any kind of playoffs were in question from the onset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after a pause, the green light was given for the fall scholastic campaign to commence - less football - and something called a ‘playoff experience’ was granted which allowed teams to play in a couple postseason games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That ‘postseason experience’ was better than nothing as the top teams certainly got their due, earning regional championships in the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you know what the problem was?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every team was invited to play in the postseason, in spite of record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant a squad like the Manchester boys soccer team, a program that did not win a match last season, played games in the ‘postseason experience’ bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t think a squad like that should be allowed to participate in the ‘playoffs’ because if there wasn’t a pandemic, a winless team wouldn’t be playing postseason ball in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One size does not fit all, nothing was truly earned, and the postseason is a privilege for teams that have - at least - a .400 record - just like at any other time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yes, the CIAC did a very good job in making two divisions for the fall ‘postseason experience’ with the teams who did not fare as well compete against each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there wasn’t any need for that second division because teams with less than a .400 winning percentage shouldn’t be playing in the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I’m I being too critical here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t think so and to prove my point, let’s break down CCC, Region B boys soccer division and our Bristol teams - Central and Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams and Lancers ended the regular season by winning 54.5-percent of their games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central finished in third place at 5-4-2 while Eastern was one spot behind with a ledger of 4-3-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington took the top seed with a 10-0-1 record (.955) while Plainville placed second at 8-4 (.667).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those were the top four teams in Region B and each program deserved a ‘postseason experience’ appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe Southington (4-5-3) and Avon (4-6-2), the fifth and sixth place teams deserved a playoff slot but did Lewis Mills (2-6-4) or winless New Britain earn that same distinction?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the problem with including everyone since there’s a huge difference between a top squad like Region C’s Glastonbury (10-0-1) and Manchester (0-9-1) at the bottom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps Southington and Avon deserved a one-game showdown between each other because of record. I’d be in favor of that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pandemic or not, the postseason is simply not for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it looks like that experience, or something similar, is coming down the pike for boys and girls basketball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, why is every team getting an invitation to play in the postseason?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even in girls scholastic basketball last year, which filled all thirty-two positions over the five brackets, there were teams that didn’t make the cut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, squads with three victories made up the field in Class S girls hoop but there was a limit in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bluntly, the playoffs aren’t for each and every program and the ‘postseason experience’ should be modified as such.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m extremely thankful that our student athletes are playing again but let’s establish some guidelines and minimum standards which would help make the ‘postseason experience’ legitimate instead of a wacky free-for-all where winning isn’t a requirement.</p>
