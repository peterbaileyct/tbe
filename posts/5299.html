<p>MERIDEN - A very windy day played havoc with the Bristol Eastern softball squad on Friday afternoon as the team competed against a very good Maloney program on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers nabbed an early lead then saw the Spartans tie things up before going ahead in the fray again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Maloney scored a combined eight runs over the fourth, fifth and sixth innings to take control of the showdown as Eastern absorbed a tough 11-6 loss over a ‘blustery’ game from the Dunn Sports Complex in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney improved to 8-2 overall off the win - qualifying for the state tournament - while Eastern evened its ledger to 3-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers managed 11 hits off Spartans’ pitching which included six extra-base hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ashley Serafin, Janessa Gonzalez, Ali Tellier, and Riley Giblin all hit doubles while Jasmine Perez flipped in a triple to lead the offensive charge for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern chucker Ali Tellier allowed just eight hits and battled in the circle but mistakes on both offensive and defensive fronts doomed the visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The wind proved to be quite challenging today as fly balls were moving all over the place,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “Defense and poor base-running for the Lancers proved costly as they outhit the Spartans but gave up six unearned runs and, in the end, didn't have enough to outlast a pesky Maloney team.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern committed five errors while Maloney had four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mel Perez earned the win for Maloney but had to survive all the elements to do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perez helped her own cause with a double while Morgan Pelletier and Avery Benigni added three-base hits for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led 2-0 through two-and-a-half innings of play before a three run third by Maloney propelled the home squad to a 3-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after five innings of action, the Lancers trailed 9-3 and never got back into the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is in the thick of things to open the month of May which included a city series showdown against Bristol Central plus two contests on the road in Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all starts next Monday, May 3 as the Eastern squares off against Edwin O. Smith high school from Storrs at 3:45 from the softball field on King Street (I hope coach Redman gives the Panthers some gas money for their long ride down to Bristol, especially if E.O. Smith loses…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Wednesday, it’s the rivalry that never disappoints as Eastern tangles with Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both those games commence at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And next Friday, it’s a double dip in Farmington as Eastern has two games against the River Hawks from Tunxis Mead Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game times are set for 4 and 6 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
