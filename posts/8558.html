<p>The first set was an example of total domination as the Lancers scored points in bunches. Avon could get nothing going as Eastern served extremely well and dominated the net.</p>

<p>In sets two and three, Lancer Coach Stefanie Reay took the chance to play many different combinations and give her younger players some extensive varsity experience. The scores were closer, but the outcome was never in doubt.</p>
