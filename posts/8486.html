<p>WEST HARTFORD - In an early evening CCC Interdivisional contest on Friday against Bristol Eastern, the boys soccer program from Hall showed why it remains a&nbsp; state champion contender and one of the top five teams in all of Connecticut.</p>

<p>The Class LL giant from West Hartford defeated the Lancers by a 7-0 push, moving the outfit to 7-0-2 on the campaign.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the third straight victory by Hall - winning its matches by a 18-1 tally over that stretch run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 2-7 overall as dynamic forward Lucas Almeida (three goals) notched a hat trick for the winners.</p>

<p>"We were over-matched today by a smooth moving unit," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "We had  some good moments, but they had too many good minutes. [Keeper] Dylan Piazza did a good job stepping in for injured goalie Carlos Portillo while Donyell Maxwell and Rocco Barbino had outstanding efforts.”</p>

<p>Portillo made a save before leaving the match while Piazza had 14 - coming under severe fire by Hall but he more than held his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall's Tyler Fairchild&nbsp;scooped up six saves to lead the winners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week, Eastern travels to Tolland on Tuesday and hosts East Hartford Thursday, both at 3:45 p.m., in two CCC Interdivisional showdowns.</p>
