<p>BRISTOL - The way the softball game was proceeding between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern squads on Thursday afternoon, seven innings was not going to cut it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after the Rams squared up a run in the top of the eighth inning, the Lancers were going to have to respond in some sort of fashion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Down to its final out, the Kingstreeters ended up making the ultimate response to end the city series tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Janessa Gonzalez tied up the game with an RBI single and then Jazmyn Browne blasted out the game-winning hit as Eastern (5-3) came from behind to seize a 2-1 victory from the softball field on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[Browne] is a disciplined hitter up there,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “She doesn’t chase bad pitches. She’s patient up there, she got a pitch she could get her bat on, put it in a perfect spot [and] won the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (6-3) squandered several chances to take the lead in the game but it just took one swing of the bat from the ultra-talented Gwen Torreso in the top of the eighth to tally what appeared to be the game-winning hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She sent a ball just over the fence in centerfield and off the solo shot, the Rams grabbed a 1-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then the Gonzalez/Browne duo made it academic with the back-to-back RBI singles in the bottom of the frame to help the Lancers seize the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s the best game I’ve seen, not just between Central and Eastern, it’s the best I’ve seen in five years,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “We put the pressure on [Eastern] to get a base hit and they earned it. They hit two balls really hard and they were right there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the game, the Rams quickly went on the offensive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central loaded the bases in the first inning with one gone as Sam Sklenka singled over the second baseman, Gwen Torreso added a base-hit to right-center and Lorelei Stancavage was plunked by a pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern ace Ali Tellier (six hits, seven K’s) fanned both Sophia Torreso and Leah Sklenka as Central came away from the inning without a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Central’s Alex Sciarretto (eight hits, 10 K’s) fanned the side in the first as the game quickly moved into the second frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She was light’s out the first three innings,” said Hayes of Sciarretto. “Eastern put the ball in play a little bit and they got some runners on base but I thought she did a good job getting out of jams. To be honest, that’s the first time we’ve pitched out of jams in a couple of games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto helped her cause with one out in the second as she sent a scorcher to center and was sent to second via a bunt by Kayla St. Onge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Tellier struck out Kaley Laird as the Lancers escaped another jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomfoolery struck Eastern in the bottom half of the tilt as Riley Giblin was hit-by-pitch and off a sac bunt from Gonzalez, the lead runner moved to second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Giblin never stopped at second as first baseman Sophia Torreso quickly threw the ball to Janessa Bartell at third base, applying a slick tag for a double play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Sam Sklenka opened the third inning by getting plunked by a ball, stole second and ended up on third with two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She ended up stranded while on the Eastern side, Alex Shorette created some excitement to lead things off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shorette jammed a double to left for Eastern’s first and only extra-base hit of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone, Tellier came back from a 0-2 count to draw a walk and when Sam Policki raced out an infield hit, Eastern had the bases juiced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central’s Leah Sklenka ran down a Jasmine Perez foul ball in right field for a huge inning-ending out and the Eastern rally was squashed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with Leah Sklenka up at the plate to begin the fourth, she drilled a ball to right which was dropped for the only miscue of the game and the runner made it to third base safely as the Rams threatened once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three consecutive groundouts ended the inning as the contest remained a 0-0 stalemate as four consecutive rallies by Central were stopped by the Eastern defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had people on base all day long,” said Hayes. “It happens. That’s a testament to [Tellier]. I think that’s great catching too. They kept us off-balanced, jammed us inside and squared up one ball all day long that went over the fence.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the stanza, Giblin led off with a full-count walk and when Gonzalez grounded out, the lead runner made it safely to second base and stayed there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Browne walked to put two runners on, but Shorette followed with a hot shot that Laird nabbed at second base for an out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She quickly chucked the ball to first base for an inning-ending double play and the city rivals moved into the fifth frame without the benefit of a score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the fifth, Laird slipped a blooper to left and, once again, the visiting aggression had something brewing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But to end the inning, Gonzalez gunned down Laird attempting to steal second as another opportunity came and when for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never put anything together in the fifth as Sciarretto generated strikeouts seven and eight to keep the contest a 0-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso earned a trip to first base via a hit-by-pitch with one away in the sixth and when Leah Sklenka grounded out, the lead runner moved into scoring position with two gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bartell jammed a ground ball to Giblin who easily tagged the first base bag for the out to keep Central off the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policki opened the bottom of the sixth with a Texas leaguer to short right and was moved over to second off a sacrifice bunt by Perez.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Giblin sent a flare to left and even as the fielder bobbled the ball, Policki was held at third base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giblin ended up at second to put two runners in scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso then made a brilliant one-handed catch in foul territory for the second out and when Sciarretto fanned Brown, opportunity came and went for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, in the seventh inning, one run would be the magic number for either team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird laid down a perfect bunt with two outs and beat out the throw over a bold gambit, but Sam Sklenka popped out in foul territory to Gonzalez behind the plate to end the threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the seventh, Shorette singled to center and when Serafin sacrificed the runner to second, Eastern had two chances to drive in the winning run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto struck out Makayla Antunes and Tellier was just thrown out at first - forcing one final inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to open the eighth, Gwen Torreso sent a ball over the fence in center as the homer made it a 1-0 game as Central had the momentum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You have to tip your cap to Gwen, hitting one out there in the top of the eighth,” said Redman. “It was a good hitter hitting a good pitch out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier eventually induced two strikeouts to limit the damage as Eastern was forced to respond, now trailing by a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Eastern ended the classic confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the final frame, Policki sent a bloop single to right and Jasmine Perez’s sacrifice moved the lead runner to second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then with two gone, Gonzalez slipped a single into center - a clutch hit - as Policki came home to tie things up at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She hasn’t stopped, she hasn’t let up. She still grinds,” said Redman of Gonzalez. “She makes that play behind the plate [in foul territory] to end the inning. It wasn’t a gimme especially with the gusts of wind that we had today. Obviously, she gets the big game-tying hit. She’s having a ball this year [and] she’s playing really well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez ran to second on the throw-in and it was up to Browne to close the contest out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Browne won it with her hit to left-center as Gonzalez scored - propelling the Lancers to the huge come from behind win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hat’s off to them,” said Hayes of Eastern. “I thought that was some great execution with runners in scoring position.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s terrible someone had to lose this game because both teams deserved to win,” said Redman. “Both teams left it all out there. Both pitchers, wow, pitched sensationally.”</p>
