<p>The Bristol Edition has received some requests from city residents asking us to remind Bristol homeowners to remove their leaves from the catch basins at their curbs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is the request on the Bristol Public Works Department website:</p>

<p><br><strong>WATER MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Residents are encouraged to clear leaves and other debris from the tops of catch basins abutting their property during the fall leaf collection period to help prevent localized flooding conditions during the fall and winter months.Â </em><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When flooding occurs on city roads, it becomes a hazard for all drivers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is specially problematic when the overnight temperatures go below freezing, causing the ponded water to become a dangerous sheet of ice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking a few minutes to remove the leaves from the basin areas keeps the roads safer for all of us.</p>
