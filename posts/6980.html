<p>Tonight, the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League will begin the 2021 postseason at Palmer Field in Middletown -- meaning the Bristol Greeners will see its first ever action in the GHTBL playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Games commence tonight with two contests, including the Greeners in action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game one, the ninth ranked Hartford Colts (6-12) look to upset eighth rated South Windsor Phillies (7-11) at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the second game, No. 10 Bristol (5-13) squares off against No. 7 Malloves Jewelers (7-11) at 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has the firepower to hang with the Jewelers and while the Greeners are 0-2 against its opponent tonight, both regular season games were extremely close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 2, Bristol fell to the Jewelers 3-2 from Muzzy Field in Bristol, and in the rematch on June 13, the Greeners lost 7-6 at Palmer Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consolation bracket games will start Sunday from McKenna Field in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The annual double-elimination playoff tournament will conclude at McKenna Field on Aug. 16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Admission is $10 per person for a ticket to the entire tournament and kids 14 and under is free.&nbsp;</p>
