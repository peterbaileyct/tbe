<p>The final stats are in for both the girls lacrosse programs at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And each squad had some historic offensive totals as the programs in town continue to grow, continue to improve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had an incredible run this season, winning eight of its 12 regular season matches and qualifying for a home game in state tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 8-4, that meant several players put together career-high scoring totals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sadye Kowalczyk, a tremendous senior midfielder, went for 47 goals in 2021 which ended up establishing a new Bristol Central school record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lexi Michaud, another senior midfielder, not only tallied 15 goals but helped to set up the offense as she dished out 19 assists.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And another midfielder, senior soccer standout Lily Hansen, added 11 goals to the till while sophomore Emily Lowe also notched 11 goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Super sophomore Rachel Wygant flipped in 10 goals while Alyah Warren - an excellent goaltender - was outstanding over her junior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central did not lose a match over the month of April, going 3-0 to start out with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Rams won its first three matches in May to race out to a 6-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dropping back-to-back decision to Suffield, Central ended up sweeping Wolcott (15-2) back on May 21 and after a tough 7-6 loss to Cromwell, the Rams had a tremendous 13-12 overtime win at Bristol Eastern on May 24 - winning their eighth match of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That eight-win season also meant several players would be making the CCC South, All-Conference squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kowalczyk, Hansen, Michaud, Jenna Lowe (defense), and Warren all made the CCC South, All Conference team off that outstanding season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was eighth in the CIAC Class M tournament bracket this year but dropped a hard-fought 20-4 decision on June 1 to end the season at 8-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have built a tremendous program that will continue to improve over the next couple years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[We had] five double digit goal scorers, and 14 different girls score” this year said Central girl coach Kyle Phelan via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then from the Eastern front, while the Lancers were 3-10 this past spring, the team has improved by leaps and bounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ciara Collins was fantastic this year as she scored 50 goals, averaging nearly 3.9 goals-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior’s fifty goals are the most goals scored in a season in public school play in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t just Collins that put up those All-State like numbers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Kate Kozikowski wasn’t far behind Collins’ totals as she roped up 40 goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman Emma Stavens tallied 35 goals while Vanessa Drury, another promising freshman, added 21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Alyssa Kehler kicked in 11 goals as she finished up a tremendous senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s 3-10 ledger was as deceiving as could be in 2021 with the program losing four matches by three goals or less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers fell to St. Paul Catholic by a 13-10 push on April 26 and then ended their campaign with three losses by a total of four goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s victories this season came against Enfield (18-5) on April 14, Edwin O. Smith (13-12) on April 22 and versus Lewis Mills (19-4) on May 20.</p>
