<p>GLASTONBURY – With elimination on the line, the Bristol Knights of the Connecticut Twilight League put together a complete game effort against the Wethersfield Dodgers, posting a 6-1 victory from Riverfront Park on Wednesday evening to stay alive in CTL postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The elimination game saw the fourth ranked Knights (2-1 tournament, 13-10-2 overall) end the season for the sixth rated Dodgers (1-2, 10-14) as Wethersfield had little answer for Bristol’s Mark Creamer on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creamer went the distance with his knuckleball churning, spacing out four hits, walked only one while tallying five strikeouts and allowing a solitary run late in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s great,” said Bristol coach Chris McGrath of Creamer. “I only met Mark this year but what he’s brought to the table…I think he led the league in batting as well. That guy can do it all. I’m jealous.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights tallied at least one hit in every inning, played superior defense and zipped up consecutive runs in the first and second stanza to help support Creamer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first, Wethersfield’s Kez Douglas (2-for-3, HR) smacked a one out single to right as starting pitcher Cam Berry came in to pinch run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Creamer fanned Rob Correia looking while Nolan Devivo grounded out to Zach Rinkavage at second to end the half inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Bristol got right to work from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the first pitch for the Knights, Alejandro Soriano slammed a long shot near the corner in left field for a double and a wild pitch sent the runner to third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with one gone, Georgie Santiago (two RBI) belted a two-base hit of his own to right, easily scoring Soriano, as Bristol led 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colby Jones followed with an RBI double to the gap in right field and when Santiago tagged the plate, it was a 2-0 game through one completed frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creamer went 1-2-3 in the top of the second while Rinkavage drew a one-out walk on the flip side while Soriano was hit by pitch to put men on first and second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Plantamuro (3-for-4) followed up with a single that bounced off the second basemen’s glove to plate Rinkavage while Santiago’s sacrifice fly to center scored Soriano as Bristol entered the third tilt on the right side of a 4-0 score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our offense came together,” said McGrath. “Everything was clicking from top to bottom. Everyone was hitting.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the third with two out, Berry ditched a ball deep to the hole at shortstop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plantamuro grabbed the ball and, as we’ve seen so many times out of the Bristol shortstop, made a ridiculous, jumping throw from just inside the outfield grass that was completely on the money to first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berry was just called safe on the spectacular play but Bristol quickly got out of the inning and back to the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A slick 6-4-3 double play by Wethersfield erased a single from Julio Ortiz-Rivera and through three, it was still a 4-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creamer allowed a walk in the fourth but nothing came of it and in the bottom of the tilt, the Knights added a run to its till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rinkavage drew a base-on-balls and when Plantamuro stroked a two-out single, two runners were on for the Knights and tomfoolery struck Wethersfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Dodgers caught Rinkavage off second base, attempted to pick him off the bag but the ball was thrown away to short centerfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the error, Rinkavage hustled all the way home as Bristol nabbed a 5-0 push through four frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the fifth, Santiago made an outstanding catch of a Nico Spuches fly-ball as the visitors were retired in order once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights added a run in the bottom of the fifth via an RBI single from Justin Martella as Bristol etched up a 6-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Santiago was at it again in the sixth, tracking down another ball in left for an out as the trio of Santiago (left field), Ortiz-Rivera (center) and Soriano (right) were sharp defensively – scooping in everything hit to the outfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pitching in front of this defense is different,” said McGrath. “All three of these guys can pretty much chase down anything. It’s pretty fun. You’re a different pitcher with them behind you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the sixth, Douglas finally got his squad on the board, drilling a home run over the fence in right, as the deficit was chopped to 6-1 through six innings of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the game, Bristol induced a 6-4-3 double play and Creamer’s fifth and final strikeout ended the contest and season for the Dodgers as the Knights stayed alive in tournament play with the 6-1 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, Bristol plays at 8 p.m. against the winner of the Orange Fat Cats Brewers/Connecticut Orioles game from the previous day in Glastonbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of that game advances to championship week, commencing from Muzzy Field in Bristol on Monday at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re excited,” said McGrath about advancing in tournament play. “Both of these teams are loaded with talent so tomorrow won’t be any cakewalk.”</p>
