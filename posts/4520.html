<p>MERIDEN – The Bristol swimming co-op enjoyed a good day in the pool on Wednesday from Platt High School, but the locals were foiled by the Meriden contingent in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol fell by a 97-87 final in Meriden, earning several first place finishes along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a really good meet, the boys swam events they were uncomfortable with and still pulled out some fast races,” said Bristol co-op coach Adrienne Bentley. “We had 16 season best times. The score went back and forth and [was] tied a few times.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Meriden took five individual wins and snared two of the three relay challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over those two relay losses for Bristol, a miscommunication in lane assignments caused disqualifications that aided the Meriden co-op on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The error in lane assignments, which cost us the meet, was my fault,” said Bentley.&nbsp;“[But] in my eyes, they achieved their meet goal. I asked them to swim hard and fast and they did.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Bristol had several first place tallies, including three by Gabriel Bartolome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He won the 200 freestyle, 100 freestyle and was a participant on the winning 400 freestyle relay team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drew Fries took the 50 freestyle event “coming out of retirement to pull off a fast and solid win,” according to Bentley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikel Palaj was also a three event victor (100 butterfly, 100 breaststroke, and 400 freestyle relay) while Noah Taylor and Davis Kroll made up half of Bristol’s winning 400 freestyle relay team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But up and down the line-up, Bentley was pleased with what she saw.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[We had] outstanding swims by Davis Kroll in the 100 freestyle and 100 backstroke and Aidan Collins in the 200 IM and 100 breaststroke,” said Bentley.&nbsp;“Tyler Wilson [had his] best time in diving and 100 breaststroke [and] Jacob Wilson [had his] best time in 100 freestyle.”</p>

<p>Bristol is back in action next Saturday from the Cornerstone Aquatics Center in Avon at 2:30 p.m. in a CCC Region D encounter with the Falcons.&nbsp;</p>
