<p>NEW BRITAIN – The Bristol Eastern softball team continued to go through the month of May undefeated as the locals blasted New Britain by a 19-0 final, via the mercy rule, on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ‘home’ game took place from Chesley Park in New Britain as the field from King Street was not ready for play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant the Kingstreeters were on the road for a home game but the ultimate location meant very little in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 8-3 overall and have won five straight contests. The 19 runs were a season high for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain fell to 2-8 overall and ended up with more errors (four) than hits (one), thanks in part to Eastern pitcher Ali Tellier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chucker’s one-hitter against the Hurricanes included 11 strikeouts over the five innings of work. Overall, New Britain had only three base runners all afternoon as Tellier walked just one batter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jasmine Perez had a big day at the plate for Eastern, going 3-of-4 with three runs and three RBI, while Eastern catcher Janessa Gonzalez went a perfect 3-for-3 with a double, a walk, three runs scored and two RBI.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Browne was 1-for-1 as she tripled, was hit by a pitch, walked twice, and nabbed four RBI to lead the offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Sophia Nocera (1-for-1, RBI), Sarah Lacouture (1-1, RBI) and Tellier (1-for-2, 3 runs, 2 walks) all made gains from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Eastern racked up 11 hits and made the contest academic after just the first inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored four runs in the first frame, scored two more in the second and after a 10-run explosion in the third, it was an 18-0 contest as the Hurricanes never had a chance in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the week, the Lancers have back-to-back games on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday’s game is a big one as Eastern gets a rematch against Berlin from the softball field on King Street in Bristol while the following day, the Lancers battle Platt from Meriden.</p>
