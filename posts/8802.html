<p>The Lancers trailed 24-16 in the final set, and then staged an incredible rally, scoring ten straight points to post a 26-24 win to stave off the Rams. Abby Jones served with great effect during the streak and Hannah Webber dominated the net.</p>

<p>Asked about the end to set three, Coach Stefanie Reay said, “I told them, our goal has been to finish, and there is no better time to do it, but you have to do it one point at a time.” Then the Lancers went out and did exactly that. Match over.</p>
