<p>Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont wasted little time on Thursday in announcing that a number of "high risk"  youth and scholastic sports have been postponed to start the winter season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was made clear is that "medium risk" sports would eventually be allowed but the participants had wear face masks or coverings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, "high risk" sports were put on hold for the remainder of 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What does Connecticut deem as "high risk" sports?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boys lacrosse, boxing, rugby, competitive cheer, dance, martial arts, wrestling, and 11-on-11 football are all considered "high risk" sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fall, 11-on-11 football was put on hold but the delay of sports like cheer, dance, and wrestling will have a huge impact in Bristol during the winter months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sports that will eventually commence when allowed by the CIAC include basketball, gymnastics, ice hockey, indoor track, and swimming -- each fitting that "medium risk" criteria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lamont also released "Sports Sector Rules" that athletes and spectators alike will have to abide by.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those rules include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>No hosting in Connecticut of competitions or tournaments for both Medium and High risk sports.</li><li>Teams from Connecticut cannot travel out of state for competition.</li><li>There will be a limit on spectators while facilities and leagues must have protocols for spectators, rosters, and safety.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As reported earlier, the winter scholastic sports season has been delayed as the Department of Public Health was going to release its new guidelines for competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A new start date could be decided upon at a CIAC Board of Control meeting on Nov. 17.</p>
