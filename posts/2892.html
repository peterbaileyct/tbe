<p>Bristol is highlighted for the collaboration between the Department of Public Works and the Bristol Board of Education to create and establish outdoor classrooms at each elementary school in Bristol, according to a release from the city.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The two departments worked together to install small community gardens at all city public schools to teach students about composting and how they could live more sustainably by raising their own produce, consume, dispose of via composting, and then use the resulting compost in the community gardens. The gardens were such a success other sustainability teaching opportunities were explored,” said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu in the release.</p>

<p>“As a result, Public Works employee Lindsey Rivers suggested the installation of outdoor classrooms at schools to be an asset to get the students immersed in the outdoors while teaching lessons related to the gardens and other environmental science based curriculum.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Establishing the outdoor classrooms at city elementary schools is helping children engage in an outdoor setting when learning curriculum based upon nature and science,” said Councilman Greg Hahn, who serves as a member of the Public Works Board, in the release.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This connection with the surrounding nature of Bristol helps to foster a love of the environment, sustainability lessons, and helps students embrace the world as their own as they will be the future stewards of their planet,” Hahn added in the release.</p>
