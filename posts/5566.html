<p>SOUTH WINDSOR - Bristol Eastern softball’s 8-7 loss to South Windsor on Monday is a contest the program would love to forget as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a game that the Lancers (9-5) had built a 4-0 lead in after five innings of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a huge three-run home run from South Windsor’s Lyndsay Donston and an RBI single by Kenadie Gonzalez tied the contest up at 4-4 after seven completed innings - forcing extra frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern notched three runs in the top of the ninth in what appeared to be the game-winning tallies, but the Bobcats also struck for three as the game was tied 7-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the contest continued into the tenth when South Windsor finally put its game-winning drive together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace Berashski blasted out a triple in the bottom of the tenth but after two strikeouts from Eastern pitcher Ali Tellier, the game looked poised for another frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a passed ball scored Berashski from third base as South Windsor came away with a big 8-7 victory in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier was tremendous as she racked up 15 strikeouts and allowed just 11 hits over ten-plus innings of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bridget Doherty earned the victory for the Bobcats, moving to 9-5 overall off the winning endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scooped up 13 total hits as five of those went for extra-bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier and Shorette blasted shots out of the park for home runs while Sam Policki, Jasmine Perez, and Janessa Gonzalez all added doubles to lead the visiting outfit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez had an RBI double in the first frame to get Eastern on the scoreboard and when she dropped in an RBI single in the third, the Lancers led it, 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier then attempted to help her cause in the fifth and sixth stanzas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She smashed out her homer in the fifth and then added an RBI base hit in the sixth as Eastern led 4-0 going into the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Errors did not help Eastern in the least as the program committed six overall for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Bobcats tied the game up at 4-4, Tellier retired the home team in order in the eighth and the Kingstreeters went for three runs in the top of the ninth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Policki doubled to start the inning and when Jazmyn Browne drew a base-on-balls, ducks were on the pond for Shorette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She then took the ball out of the park as her three-run home run made it a 7-4 game as South Windsor was forced to respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the team did - highlighted by a two-RBI single from Lindsay Carter - and going into the 10th, the contest was still tied, this time at 7-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were retired in order in the top of the tenth and then the Bobcats scooted across one final run in the bottom of the inning as Eastern dropped a tough 8-7 decision on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier went 4-for-5 with a walk and two RBI while Ryley Giblin laid down two sacrifices that eventually helped Eastern score a couple early runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez added two hits, as did Policki, while Browne got on base three times via two walks and was hit-by-pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shorette added two runs scored and three RBI to pace the Lancers’ offense.</p>
