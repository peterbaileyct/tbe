<p>Earlier today, in what was expected in the collegiate recruitment of Bristol Central’s All-State center, Donovan Clingan made his top-8 schools known via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan had twenty or so offers to mull over but he finally put some eager programs, who thought they had a remote chance of landing the 7-foot-1, 265 center, out to pasture.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, who made the list to land the 2022 graduate?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s go with Ohio State and Rutgers - with Bristol coach Steve Pikiell - on the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, Rutgers made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in thirty years. That’s a powerful recruiting inducement that Clingan might think twice about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think Clingan wants to play for Patrick Ewing at Georgetown? The Hoyas made the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will coach Juwan Howard land Clingan at Michigan State? The Wolverines think so and are on the list as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notre Dame, come on down, you’re one of the contestants on Donovan Clingan’s list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Providence? That’s not a bad choice and that program made the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, of course, Syracuse and UCONN are finalists, and it should be interesting if the big man is thinking Big East, ACC, Big Ten, or what have you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What an amazing list of schools with all eight possibilities a great call no matter how Clingan decides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Syracuse was the first school to send an offer to Clingan and you wonder if that carries any weight with the All-State talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, there’s no wrong call here and his best fit is key.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the programs that did not make Clingan’s list was Iona, coached by Rick Pitino who had professional experience with both the NewYork Knicks and Boston Celtics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one is crying over that omission, including an old school Celtics’ fan who was none too pleased about the direction of the Boston franchise in the late 1990s into the 2000s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Clingan roasted the competition for 27.3 points, 17.2 rebounds, 5.8 blocks and 3.1 assists-per-game for the Rams - leading the program to the CCC Tournament title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to <a href="http://rivals.com"><strong>rivals.com</strong></a>, he’s ranked No. 47 overall in the nation and No. 9 in the center class of 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is only the beginning of the process for Clingan and stay tuned as a remarkable young man is preparing for his next step in his collegiate future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Statement weekend for Team Spartans&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The No. 8 AAU ranked Team Spartans (MA), anchored by Clingan in the middle, took care of business at the 17U Steel Championship Pitt Jam Fest Championship held at the DLL Convention Center in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania on April 23-25.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Spartans won the title, beating Team Rio UAA 68-56 to claim the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to reports, Clingan was a force down low at both ends of the court and collected 12 points, seven rebounds and rejected three shots to help his team take the title in the championship bout.</p>
