<p>The book <strong>Rio &amp; Silas with Love,</strong> written by Bristol resident Michele Kean, was chosen as the “Little Read 2021”. A signed copy of Ms. Kean’s book was distributed to all Preschool and Kindergarten classrooms, Center-based Programs, Play and Learn Groups, and the Library. <br></p>

<p>Every child can have the opportunity to hear the story about Rio &amp; Silas, two dogs, finding love and a place they belong.</p>

<p>This will be the first year the “Little Read” book will be showcased in a Story Walk @ Rockwell Park.</p>
