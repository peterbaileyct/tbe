<p>BRISTOL – The last time the Bristol Central softball team took the field in CIAC Class L postseason play, the squad dropped a tough 5-1 decision at home to No. 18 Foran in first round play back on May 29, 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that sophomore crew, now seniors, learned from that tough outing and to open the state tournament in 2021, the 11<sup>th</sup> ranked Rams defended their home turf – needing an extra frame to seal the deal against a very good Brookfield aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because through seven innings of play, the game was a 1-1 stalemate as late heroics was going to decide the victor this time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the eighth, Central’s Janessa Bartell generated the game winning hit as the Rams picked up a huge 2-1 victory over No. 22 Brookfield to move on to second round play</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bartell, as well as blasting out the walk-off tally, went 2-for-4 on the afternoon with two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorelei Stancavage picked up two hits and ended up scoring the game-winning run for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the circle, the combination of Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto did the job for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo combined for 10 strikeouts as Torreso picked up the win in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory propelled Central to a showdown against No. 6 Ledyard on the road today at 4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Colonels were 14-2 in regular season play this season, but the 16-4 Rams have enough firepower to pull off a second round upset.</p>

<p><strong>Gwen Torreso honored</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In more postseason news for the locals, Bristol Central’s Gwen Torreso was named to the Connecticut High school Coaches Association Softball All-State Class L Team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She one was of twenty-four players honored this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso is a dual threat on both sides of the ball and one of the featured shortstops in all the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also has home run power and nearly helped the squad at Central take two wins over Bristol Eastern this year – hitting a home run at the game from King Street in a 2-1, eighth inning near miss before leading her team to a 13-2 victory against the Lancers back on May 24.</p>
