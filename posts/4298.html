<p>The Bristol Eastern football program has some players on the move, student-athletes that will be taking their skills to the next level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Logan Schenck, a versatile wide receiver, has the ability to compete collegiately while earning his education in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, the outstanding senior made a critical decision, deciding to attend Springfield College in the fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NCAA Division III institution is getting a good one, a versatile athlete that excels in just about everything he does - on and off the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Whenever I talked to Logan throughout the process, he felt really comfortable with Springfield and the coaching staff there,” said Bristol Eastern coach Anthony Julius. “They made it very clear early on that they were very interested in him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll bring some size and strength to the Springfield program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 6-foot-1, 191 pounds with excellent hands, Schenck will upgrade the receiver position for the Pride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“First off, I would like to thank my family friends, and coaches for helping me become the person that I am today and continuously support me,” said Schenck via Twitter on Monday. “With that being said, I am proud to announce that I am going to be furthering my academic and athletic career at Springfield College.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Schenck had some options as Anna Maria College showed interest in the receiver as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also visited Utica College but the senior took his time in making his ultimate decision of Springfield.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior kept busy during the scholastic season that wasn’t, working out on his own and gained experience in the Lancers’ 7-vs-7 season - which included a couple huge catches in the victory over crosstown rival Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, in 11-vs-11 play at Eastern, Schenck was second on squad in both receptions (18) and receiving yards (176).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He led the Lancers with three touchdown receptions and even threw a pass for 30 yards in 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Schenck can also play a little defense as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, he hauled in an interception for 45 yards, was second on the squad in total tackles, made 1.5 sacks and added 1.5 tackles-for-a-loss - good for seven yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given the chance at Springfield, Schenck should be able to excel at the receiver position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“His offensive skill set really fits what they’re trying to do at Springfield,” said Julius. “Logan is a big body receiver who can go up and win 50-50 balls which is something offensive coaches really like and he’s an excellent offensive blocker on the perimeter.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Springfield did not get a chance to compete on the field in 2020 but the previous season, the Pride went 6-4 and expects to build off that ledger when collegiate play resumes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coupled with a slick 4.0 GPA, Schenck should shine in his studies while also catching a ball or two along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Schenck will fit well because the program at Springfield is known for its abilities in the classroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season at Springfield, 14 student-athletes were selected as members of the National Football Foundation Hampshire Honor Society, which is composed of college football players from all divisions of play who each maintained a cumulative 3.2 GPA or better throughout their college careers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And given the caliber of athlete and student that he is, once Schenck immerses himself at Springfield, he has a chance to be something special for the Pride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Logan is a very smart football player,” said Julius. “He works really hard at what he does and takes his time to know what to do on any given play. He’s going to be an asset for that program for years to come.”</p>
