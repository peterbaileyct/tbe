<p>EAST HARTFORD – When a Bill Mason coached baseball team takes the field, the defense better be ready, awake and - frankly - alive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Mason, the king of small ball, always seems to put his players in the right position to win a game and the long-time coach of the Bristol American Legion junior baseball program nearly coached his troops back into the finals off a up-and-down regular season this past summer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defending CT Elite Baseball Association 17U champs had its collective hands full in 2021 with a small division of opponents that included a very talented West Hartford outfit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s division in Zone 1 included West Hartford (16-4, Zone 1 champions), Simsbury (11-9), Newington (8-11) and Torrington (7-13) who finished a half-game worse than Post 2 (7-12).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a very tough start, the Bristol crew flirted with .500 when the final weekend of regular season ball commenced.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Think about it, we started out at 1-6,” said Mason. “And we turned it all the way around. We had a nice streak going, nearly got back to .500.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the middle of July, Bristol started winning, posting victories over Simsbury (6-2), West Hartford (5-4), and Torrington (15-2) to get back into the swing of things.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That included big victories on the hill for Bristol’s crew of Jaydon Churchill, Mike Roalf, and Ryan Maglio.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From that 1-6 start, Post 2 got all the way back to 7-8 – a slate of games that saw Bristol go 6-2 in eight contests – with four games left to play over the weekend of July 31 when things just fell apart.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason threw just about everyone on the mound against Torrington, West Hartford, and Simsbury that fateful weekend but Bristol dropped all four games – falling to 7-12 to end regular season play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a bad weekend, it was like a rollercoaster,” said Mason. “Then we got to the playoffs and played the way we did. This was a really good season altogether for having a bunch of young guys and 17-year old’s.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And boy, did Post 2 explode over the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sneaking in as the 12<sup>th</sup> seed in the North Division Connecticut State Tournament, the locals went right to work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against No. 5 Willimantic from Rec Park, Bristol mercy ruled the squad by a 10-0 final and then on the flowing night, Post 2 defeated No. 4 Enfield on the road, 3-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The bats really came alive at the end of the year,” said Mason. “They really did.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in a nip-and-tuck contest from McKenna Park in East Hartford on August 5, Bristol squared off against rival West Hartford – the top seed in tournament play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol, with just nine players available (coach Mason actually had to warm up the right fielder before each inning), battled West Hartford to the end but fell by a single run, 3-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitcher Mitch Crowley was sensational over the losing effort as West Hartford needed late game heroics to final topple Post 2&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He pitched the game of his life today,” said Mason of Crowley. “These guys really showed a lot of guts and really showed that they liked to compete and play.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It’s all about small ball&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason has won multiple state and a New England championship using small ball as his mantra.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are home runs exciting? Absolutely.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do doubles look pretty? You bet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Mason will bunt, draw walks, and infield hit the other team to death in order to win a game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the end, four singles, base-on-balls or infield bunts that go for a hit account for the same as a solo home run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve always played that way,” said Mason about small ball. “I love playing like that, moving runners around and getting them in scoring position.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason puts the pressure on the opposing defenses to make decisions that have turned into errors and miscues in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the bottom line about small ball is that the techniques and skills that come from those little plays make big gains on the scoreboard in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It works and it keeps us in games,” said Mason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
