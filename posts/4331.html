<p>During pandemic times, the phrase ‘business as usual’ has been thrown out the window.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the players of the boys basketball team at Bristol Eastern, getting to play a little hoop won’t have the same usual reward in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are more important elements to the shortened winter campaign than state tournaments or titles in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a different season, I’ve got to tell you that,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray. “It’s not a season where you’re looking towards the state tournament. You’re looking to get better every day.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than ever, this scholastic season carries so many life lessons as the pandemic has played havoc with life in general.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even with scholastic basketball, the season was originally delayed and there was some serious thought that the winter campaign wouldn’t go on as scheduled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for now, the Lancers are in the gym and are on the verge of starting the season this coming Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re appreciative to be in the gym,” said Ray. “You’re trying to establish a positive atmosphere and culture. You want to preach to the kids every day on how important it is to be in the gym and doing things that maybe you might not have an opportunity to do in a week from the day you think that you’re going to be preparing for a game.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s an important concept to realize when you’re coaching in these circumstances.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray knows all about the importance of loss and gain during these trying and uncertain times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray, Bristol Central’s head baseball coach, lost the entire 2020 campaign due to the pandemic while he saw his season in boys soccer at Eastern delayed due to COVID this past fall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As a basketball coach, I’m thankful I’m able to be in the gym with kids that want to work hard. You’ve just got to teach them that every day is precious, the practice time is precious and the games are precious. When you get into those situations, sometimes you revert into old habits and you’re thinking about the end result. The end result is almost daily rather than four or five weeks from now.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re going to fight those battles every day and we’re going to try to get better every day and every quarter.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kids on the Eastern squad are friends and getting a chance to reconnect at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium has its own glorious rewards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just being able to share a little time in the gym is something extremely positive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just want them to understand they have to appreciate their teammates a little bit,” said Ray. “This is where we’re at right now.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while there won’t be any state tournament games in 2021, the Lancers could have a chance for some sort of postseason experience, the same situation that took place in the fall, at the end of the regular campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Ray and his program are truly appreciative about getting a chance to hit the hardwood.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just want my seniors to experience something that could have been taken away like it was in football but it wasn’t here,” said Ray. “At any point, something could happen that could take us down a different road but that’s not what we’re thinking about when we get into the gym.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So, it’s a little different than most seasons but that doesn’t mean it’s going to change for us in terms of how we approach it. But there needs to be a conversation every day about what really sports are about right now versus what they’ll be five years from now or five years before.”&nbsp;</p>
