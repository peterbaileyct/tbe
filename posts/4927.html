<p>In a news release dated March 18, the City of Bristol is reminding citizens of the upcoming due date for property taxes. The release reads as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>City of Bristol Tax Collector, Ann Bednaz, has announced that ALL SECOND INSTALLMENTS<br>OF REAL ESTATE and PERSONAL PROPERTY &amp; ALL MOTOR VEHICLE SUPPLEMENTAL TAX<br>BILLS on the 2019 Grand List were due and payable on January 1, 2021, to be received no<br>later than February 1, 2021. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the Executive Order by Governor Lamont and approved by the City of Bristol City Council, this tax deadline was extended so that the last day to pay these taxes to avoid interest is April 1, 2021.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Deferment Program provided additional relief for all Bristol residents on interest and<br>penalties by extending the grace period for property taxes for those impacted by COVID-19.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Executive Order extended the time period to pay most taxes by three months. Thus,<br>instead of February 1st being the last day to pay this year, April 1, 2021 is the last day to pay<br>without penalty.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please Note:<br>Payments must be received or USPS postmarked by April 1, 2021 or they will be considered<br>delinquent. Delinquent payments are subject to an interest charge of 1.5% per month<br>starting with the January 1, 2021 due date. The minimum calculated interest charge is $2.00<br>per CT State Statute Sec. 12-146.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taxpayers are being encouraged to mail their tax payments to: Tax Collector, City of Bristol,<br>P.O. Box 1040, Bristol, CT 06011-1040 or pay online at www.bristolct.gov. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ENTIRE 3-part bill and a self-addressed stamped envelope MUST accompany the payment if a receipt is<br>desired through the US Postal Service.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that failure to receive a bill for any reason will not invalidate the tax<br>and/or the interest penalty per state law, or avoid the real estate lien the City is required to<br>file on the land records against all properties on which there is a tax balance due after April<br>1, 2021.</p>
