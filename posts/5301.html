<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern baseball team held an early three run edge over Maloney on Friday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that push didn’t last as the Spartans scored seven runs over the middle innings to eventually square up an 8-6 victory over the Lancers in a CCC South clash from Clem J. Roy field on the campus of Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, now 1-8, had several late chances in the contest to capture the lead again but that one big hit never materialized.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney swept the season series against Eastern and moved to 7-2 overall in the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans blasted out 15 hits off four Eastern pitchers with six of those going for extra bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kam Hartenstein, Raff Rodriquez, Jack Fitzgerald, Ryan Killeen, Joseph Rodriquez all jammed out doubles while Raff Rodriquez also added a triple to the offensive onslaught.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers nabbed nine hits for the game, two apiece from Jaydon Churchill and Andrew Lozier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, Eastern held a 4-1 push after three complete frames but after seven straight runs by Maloney, the visitors captured an 8-4 edge going into the bottom half of the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill opened the first frame with a walk, Dylan Woodsome singled to center, and Andrew Lozier drew four balls to juice the bases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill scored on a passed ball and when Ben D'Amato's sacrifice fly plated Woodsome, the home squad led by a 2-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney came back with one run in the second off Eastern starter Brayden Moore when Raff Rodriquez led off with a deep double to left and scored on a double by Jack Fitzgerald that chopped the deficit in half, 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in the bottom of the third, Eastern was at it again from the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill opened the stanza with a pop fly single over shortstop while Woodsome sacrificed the runner to second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier then drove a single past the first baseman to score Churchill, making it a 3-1 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nate Ouellette followed with a single up the middle, putting runners on first and second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a pickoff play at second, pitcher Evan Avery's throw went into center field as the runners were on the move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier made it safely to third and scored when the throw in from center went wild - making it 4-1 through three completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the fourth inning, the Spartans scored twice and then in the fifth, Maloney scooped up five additional runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single by Evan Cordero, an RBI double from Ryan Killeen, and a run scoring single by Joseph Rodriquez notched two runs that chopped the deficit to 4-3 through four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a scoreless fifth frame by Eastern, Maloney scored five times off three Eastern pitchers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moore hit Avery with a pitch leading off and Raff Rodriquez followed with a triple to deep left field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fitzgerald singled in Rodriquez as Maloney took a 5-4 lead - never trailing again.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ryan Maglio relieved Moore but a single, a bad-hop double, a run scoring wild pitch, and a walk netted another two runs and brought in reliever Mike Roalf with Maloney extending its edge to 7-4.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the bases loaded,&nbsp;the Spartans batted around in the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amazingly, Avery was hit by a pitch for the second time in the stanza to drive in the fifth Maloney run, propelling the Spartans to the 8-4 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers struck back&nbsp;with two runs in the bottom of the fifth, chopping the deficit to 8-6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill led off with a double to left and Lozier had a two-base hit to right, scoring the lead runner, as Eastern chopped the deficit to 8-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, an infield error put runners on the corners and Ben D'Amato singled up the middle to score Lozier, making it an 8-6 game as Eastern was back in it and looking for more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk to Tyler Stickels loaded the bases but two strikeouts ended the threat as Maloney was still in front by two. Xx</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier came on to pitch the final two innings, holding Maloney scoreless&nbsp; and giving the Lancers’ offense six more outs to work with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern&nbsp;threatened in the sixth against reliever Sam Giacco, putting two runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single by Cole Latko and then a walk to Woodsome saw Eastern put the tying runner on with one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Giacco retired the next two batters to end the threat and the Lancers didn’t score in the seventh, falling by a 8-6 final in the end.&nbsp;</p>
