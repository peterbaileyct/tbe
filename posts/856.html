One way to gauge the health of our communities is to ask. Being aware of the small things, such as spending increases, helps us connect the dots, so to speak. Have you noticed any changes in the prices you are paying at the pump, at the grocery store, for insurance, other products, other services?

Readers Report simply asks readers to report about what they notice in these areas. Submissions should include comparisons: in March I noticed I paid $xx.xx for this item; this week, I paid $xx.xx. There is no need to try to figure out why--unless you ask someone at the concern who knows. In that event, include in your report, the name and title of the person you talked to and what he or she said. The aim is to create a more accurate picture of the effects of the economy at the grassroots level.

If you are in business, The Bristol Edition (TBE) welcomes your contributions. However, please be reminded that RR is not is a marketing vehicle, a place where to find the best prices or who is having the best deals.

As we get started with this citizen-driven public journalism enterprise, all submissions will be directed to dfortier@bristoledition.org. Submissions will be vetted, meaning anyone submitting an item may be asked to follow up. All submissions will be edited for grammar, punctuation, spelling and length. The more factual material, the better.
