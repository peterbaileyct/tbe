<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central softball squad has started its 2021 campaign with some good old fashion zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams came into play against Lewis Mills on Saturday winning two of its first three games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that trend continued as Central sank the Spartans by a 6-3 final from the BC softball field - moving to 3-1 in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, chucker Sophia Torreso took the hill and pitched the locals to the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She ramped up eight strikeouts, giving up just three hits to earn her second win of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Sam Sklenka had a great day in centerfield to solidify the defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, she scored two times while Kaley Laird nabbed three hits and snared a pair of RBI for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gwen Torreso had a tremendous afternoon at the dish, going 2-of-3 overall with a home run, scored two runs and tallied two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home run shot was the first homer at Central that cleared the fence in outfield which was installed two years ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are back in action on Monday at home against Plainville in a CCC South confrontation - starting at 3:45 p.m. from the BC softball field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils, facing several cancellations to start the season, are 0-1 this year, losing a tough 21-4 decision on Friday to Simsbury in Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the week, Central won at Hartford Public in an 18-0 romp before falling on the road to Southington in a more than respectable 9-6 loss on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTESâ€¦</strong>And what was the reward for beating Lewis Mills on Saturday: Ice cream from Rich Farm of course and it looked like the entire team scooped up a well-deserved tasty treat.</p>
