<p>PLAINVILLE – Looking to gain a bit of momentum for its city series showdown against Bristol Central, the Bristol Eastern softball squad swept a doubleheader from Plainville on Friday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scores were 15-6 and 6-1 as the Lancers moved to 13-5 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitcher Ali Tellier went the distance in both the games for Eastern, moving to 13-4 over her 17 games in the cirlce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hits came from all angles in both contests as the Blue Devils had to battle all the elements in the CCC South contests from Trumbull Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game one, which was a make-up from an earlier postponement, Plainville gave it a go – scoring three runs – as the ‘road’ team to lead 3-0 out the gate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers went for 14 hits overall, outscored the Blue Devils 15-3 the rest of the way, to secure the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Janessa Gonzalez belted out a home run to lead the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whitney Southall drew the loss for Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the second event, with the Blue Devils as the home team this time around, it was more of the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, the Lancers scooped up four runs in the top of the first and another two in the second stanza to break the game open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jasmine Perez stayed hot with another home run while Sam Policki also blasted out a homer to pace the Eastern onslaught.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier allowed just five hits in the second contest while Kayla Wisz picked up a tough loss for Plainville, now 4-15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern and Bristol Central are slated for a 4 p.m. showdown on Monday from the softball field at BCHS.</p>
