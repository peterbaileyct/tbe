<p>When former Bristol Central football standout Dathan Hickey decided to attend Yale University in New Haven, the talented athlete knew he had all the tools to excel on the gridiron and in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to date, the defender has made an impact on the field during his junior campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bulldogs have started the 2021 campaign at 1-1 and Hickey has played in both contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Holy Cross on September 18, the 6-foot-1, 200-pound defensive back tallied two tackles as Yale fell,&nbsp;20-17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of those tackles ended up going for a loss as the speedy Hickey cost the Crusaders a yard of offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the Bulldogs second game of the season versus Cornell this past Saturday, Hickey&nbsp;and company won its home opener by a 23-17 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey scooped up three tackles overall in the winning effort, making two solo tackles along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the pandemic wiped out the 2020 season, Hickey provided depth at defensive back for the Bulldogs, seeing action in nine games as a sophomore.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied 25 total tackles in 2019 and made his mark picking off opponents.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey ended up second in the Ivy League in interceptions with three, placed 24th overall in pass breakups with three and had&nbsp;one fumble recovery over an extremely busy campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During that super sophomore season, he made a season-high six tackles and added two interceptions at Cornell back on September 28, 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then as a freshman one year previous, Hickey got into in seven games at defensive back, recording 28 total tackles, one forced fumble and half a sack - again providing critical play as a critical defensive reserve over his first season of collegiate football.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey had a tremendous senior campaign at Bristol Central, playing everywhere on the field (ATH) which included quarterback, running back, and defensive back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was an All-State selection, named to the All-Central Connecticut Conference Division II West team in 2016 and 2017, and earned Walter Camp All-State honors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey also made the New Haven Register All-State Team to cap a stellar scholastic campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he truly had a senior season to remember as he scooped up 1,402 rushing yards on 199 carries while scoring 30 touchdowns.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At QB, Hickey cashed in on 37 passes for 482 yards and three touchdowns while playing extremely well defensively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey collected 48 tackles and two interceptions on his way to Yale.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During that 2017 season for the Rams, Hickey helped turn things around off a tough 2-3 start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won five straight games to finish Hickeyâ€™s senior season with a stellar 7-3 ledger.</p>
