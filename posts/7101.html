<h5>Farrell, who also serves as the Principal of Stafford School, delivered a nice mix of jazz, soul, and pop favorites, and had the large audience singing and dancing along with her throughout the night.</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h5>One of the highlights of the evening was her rendition of the song “Fly Like an Eagle.”  While Farrell was singing, a large contingent of her Stafford students and teachers danced along with school’s mascot, the eagle. <br></h5>

<h5>I <strong>cannot resist an editorial comment. When I was in the third grade, I can’t remember going to a concert where my principal sang to a huge audience. Then again, my principal was a member of the Sisters of Saint Joseph, and she had a hard time singing “Tantum Ergo,” never mind “Fly Like an Eagle.” She also lacked the charisma Farrell exhibited throughout a delightful evening.</strong></h5>
