<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight years have passed since I arrived in Los Angeles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A high school and college’s worth of time and experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One State University stacked on top of a Bristol Eastern high school education.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And everyday I am reminded that I am grateful for my Bristol roots.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The move to L.A. may have been preordained. My sister skipped town as soon as she could. With eight years of prior experience, she told me to do the same. She saved up her earnings from Baskin-Robbins and Theis Steel Mill and headed west to the land of make believe; the land that encourages you to make what you believe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My “move out money” was saved up from my first and only salaried job in New York. I was a spreadsheet jockey mining data and making sure publishers and songwriters got paid. On its best days I was helping out the little guy, on its worst, drowning in an inoffensively beige sea of cubicles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn’t only her advice that led me here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I heard stories of the snakes sunning themselves on rocks of opportunity. That intrigued me. And I have had a taste of that opportunity. I’ve zig-zagged across the United States and Europe playing sold out shows in London, Paris, New York, and Copenhagen. I’ve received Emmy nominations, gold records, writing awards, and acknowledgment from childhood heroes. My work has drawn the attention of Elon Musk, the former White House and was even an answer on Jeopardy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the same time I was also warned. It would not be easy. Plastic people with their poisonous intentions awaited me. This was all true.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have had my fair share of the necessary defeats needed for a few sweet victories. I would have to (and I did) live on couches, love seats, sofas - lost rental deposits to heroin addicts, worked questionable craigslist jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have watched much more talented people than myself rise only to fall and be smashed on the rocks of this seemingly random universe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m not a total asshole and I know when Fortune has shined Herself down upon me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then there is that Bristol-born thing that has helped: I was born of wet winters - slick and treacherous. I was and am Bristol-born. It is this hard earned East coast Bristol-born perseverance. It is this foundation that I,that we, we Bristolites, share. It helps us get up quicker than the others. It helps us work with what we’ve got because we are keenly aware that it may be all we ever get.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the engine that pushes me, us, often unwillingly, in to the next day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are born into wet winters, slick and treacherous. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve shoveled sleet off of packed ice and salted and re-salted concrete sidewalks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of this work so our neighbors can walk safely down glowing Christmastime streets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we too can watch a fine snow fall past the streetlights. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stick it out through March to see a flowering May. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight years have passed since I left Bristol and every day I wonder if it is possible to return, how I can return. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And I think that maybe I can do this, reconnect, through these dispatches from L.A.? Maybe not. We shall see.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The plan is to write weekly, share my experiences here, have you join me, maybe share some time with you in your home—or at least on your small screen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Until then, be well.</span></p>
