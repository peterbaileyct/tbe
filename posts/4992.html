<p>Christmas came early for the UMass Lowell men’s cross country and track &amp; field teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or maybe vice versa as Bristol senior Nate DeAngelo will be taking his talents to Lowell, Massachusetts this coming fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a tremendous 2020 scholastic campaign in cross country this year, DeAngelo is ready for the challenge that the collegiate level will bring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Congrats Nate,” said Central cross country coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk via Twitter on Wednesday. “UMass Lowell is lucky to have you. Your BC Family is behind you every step of the way.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo was one of the elite runners in the state this season and then proved himself in other places as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the events that put him on the map outside of Connecticut was the 5k challenge at the Garden State Track Club High School Fall Showcase Open event from Edison Park, New Jersey last Halloween.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo earned a medal with an amazing third place finish, ending the event with a fantastic time of 15:01.66 which included a final 66-second lap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, to end November, DeAngelo and a small group of runners took part of the 12th Annual Rock Northeast High School Club Cross Championships from the Twin Ponds on the Farm in Montgomery, New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 5000 meter showdown, the senior from Central placed 27th in the Championship/Seeded race with a time of 16:15 and was only six-seconds away from making a top-20 finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the regular season for Bristol Central this year, DeAngelo was the featured runner in CCC, Region B.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo won the CCC B championship from New Britain with a time of 15:42.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in early November, DeAngelo and Central defeated Farmington, 23-38, with the senior establishing a new course record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His time of 16:15 was a new standard at the course at Winding Trails in Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Angelo had a personal best time of 15:31 this year in Central’s regular season victory over New Britain from Stanley Quarter Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior also established a course record at Rockwell Park on October 1 versus Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His time of 16:33.7 set the tone for another successful season by the Rams’ outstanding program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the Connecticut High School Coaches Association released its 2020 boys Cross Country All-State list, DeAngelo made the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo is also a two-time CCC South All-Conference honoree in cross country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has been a force at indoor events as well, breaking the school record in the 3200 on February 20, 2020 with a time of 9:28 which saw him earn a spot at the New England's.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, DeAngelo helped the boys program earn the Class L runner-up trophy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This 3200 was one of the most exciting races I have ever seen,” said Stafford-Kirk at the time. “It ended with Nate DeAngelo crossing the line as Class L 3200 meter Champion and this proud coach with tears in her eyes. Nothing short of amazing and inspiring.”</p>
