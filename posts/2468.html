<p>A truckload of fresh food will be distributed at the Public Works Yard at 95 Vincent P. Kelley Rd., today, between 4 and 6 p.m., according to a media alert from the mayor's office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Volunteers have set up stations to handle five cars at a time. Food boxes will then be loaded into the back seat or the trunk of each car. Once five cars have their food, another five will advance to the stations until the food has been distributed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The distributed is modeled after one used for household hazardous waste collections.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the release, United Way's Donna Osuch helped orchestrate the food distribution effort after she learned about a federal grant in Torrington and then alerting the mayor's office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grant is from the United States Department of Agriculture Farmers to Families Produce Distribution program. </p>

<p>For more information on the Farmers to Families program, please call the Mayorâ€™s Office at 860-584-6250.</p>
