<p>Distribution will take place from 10am-Noon, or until the boxes run out at the Bristol Department of Public Works Garage at 95 Vincent P. Kelly Road. Follow the signage from Middle Street to Cross Street to Vincent P. Kelly Rd, going by the traffic pattern developed by the Traffic division. </p>

<p>“The boxes are large, so we also encourage people to share with a neighbor or family members to ensure nothing goes to waste,” said Donna Osuch, President of the United Way. “There are 1,000 boxes this week, so we are encouraging those who need it the most to come through. In December, we had many cars asking for multiple boxes. We reserve the right to limit boxes so we can have maximum households receive something. If you have multiple households in one car, we will try to accommodate people to the best of our ability.”</p>

<p>The pallets of food boxes will be unloaded from the trucks and divided with volunteers at each station. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The line of cars will be directed into drive-thru lines where the food will be placed into the back seat or trunk of each vehicle. The entire distribution is contact-less and adheres to all Covid precautions. . </p>

<p>The distribution event has a snow date of Sunday, February 28. <br></p>

<p>“We strongly ask that people NOT arrive early,” said Police Chief Brian Gould. “That negatively impacts our ability to set up and negatively impacts the area businesses.”</p>
