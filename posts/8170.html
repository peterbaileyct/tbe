<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team, building upon its tremendous 2-1 win over Wethersfield on Tuesday, got right back to work on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern turned away Platt of Meriden by a 7-0 push from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory moved the locals to 2-3 overall as the team is on the cusp of reaching .500 for the first time this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Platt, it took just five minutes for Eastern the snatch lead for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers broke open the scoring when Emily Nelson stole the ball and took a slick shot from the corner of the 18 to give Eastern a quick 1-0 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five minutes later, Ciara Collins and Bella Sanchez combined on a sweet give and go - resulting in Collins netting her first of two goals as Eastern was up 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a reversal, Sanchez was on the receiving end from Collins as her timely pass across the box found Sanchez in the middle as the Lancers’ third goal of the game came just twelve minutes in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Eastern’s Megan Krok scored her first goal of the 2021 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breanna Venturo-Nelson slotted a beautiful ball to Krok for that first goal and Collins nabbed a loose ball, found a scoring angle, and deposited her second goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with 13 minutes before intermission, it was a 5-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then five minutes before the break, the Lancers scored twice to effectively end the match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, Roy passed to Krok for her second goal of the afternoon and just thirty-seconds later, Sanchez pressured the keeper, stole the ball, and blasted in Eastern’s seventh goal of the first half.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the second half of the match, Eastern coach Scott Redman had his subs in and would not run up the score, and worked on passing and defense the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers did not score again as Eastern hit the pay window via the 7-0 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
