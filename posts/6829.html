<p>Was a three-peat in the cards for the Bristol Merchants of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League in 2006?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two-time defending Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League champs lost several of its players from the past two years but added a couple key components for a possible title run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Bunty Ray’s fifth campaign as manager of the Merchants and his squad was looking for a third straight championship - the first since People’s Bank pulled off the feat over the years 2000-2002.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team did lose a little pop as Matt Hackney ended up playing for the New Haven County Cutters in 2006 but newcomers Rex Cone and Clint Mitchell helped to reinforce the outfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each player had critical hits and timely at-bats throughout the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GHTBL Pitcher of the Year in 2005, Jerry Hasler, returned while Chris Strahowski, Eric Butkiewicz, Justin Fuller and Brian Archibald helped to boost another strong rotation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scott Martin was hurt early in the season and did not finish the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol returned a veteran crew to the infield which included Rick Barrett, Adam Peters, and Rick Hewey along with first team, all-league performer Nick Macellaro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catching for that superior pitching staff was Joel Stamilio and Paul Franceschi while Ray and Joe Parlante were joined in the outfield by Cone and Mitchell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chris Sawyer was also a big-time producer for the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol went a stellar 23-9 that season but did not win the postseason championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the season on May 26, Hasler, Strahowski, Fuller, and Butkiewicz combined to throw a two-hitter - tallying 12 strikeouts - over a 2-0 thumping of Mr. G’s in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Macellaro had two hits to lead the offense while Peters and Ray added the other tallies over a four-hit attack against Mr. G’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Macellaro smacked a double in the first frame and scored on an error while Hewey (HBP) came home on Peter’s RBI single to left to make it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, on June 11, Ray had three hits and three runs scored as Bristol won its second game of the year, defeating Simsbury by eight runs, 9-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butkiewicz threw a three-hitter, fanning seven, and went the distance while Barrett added two hits and two RBI in as the Merchants won from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had a five-run fifth to break the contest open as Bristol moved to 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray’s fourth inning single proved to be the difference as the Merchants (4-2 overall) won in East Hartford, defeating the Aeros 2-1 on June 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald won the contest for Bristol, going the distance, as he allowed just four hits while striking out 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 18, Mitchell zipped up two hits and three RBI while Barrett and Cone picked up two hits apiece as Bristol won in Portland, snaring a 7-1 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hasler threw a complete game gem, holding Bill’s to a single run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol (6-2) scored three runs in the first inning as the Merchants never trailed over the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals were just a half game behind Vernon (6-1) for first place in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cone might have been a rookie in GHTBL action but against Bill’s in the first game of a doubleheader on June 30, the slugger had the hit of the evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tied at 1-1, Cone blasted a two-run homer in the seventh – netting the tying and go-ahead runs – as Bristol nabbed a 3-1 win against Bills in from Muzzy Field via the walk off tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then against the East Hartford Jets in game two, Peters notched an RBI single while Parlante’s sacrifice fly gave the Merchants (10-3) the lead for good over a one-run victory, 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants battled Simsbury from Memorial Park on July 19 - picking up a 5-3 victory to move to 15-7 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Peters and Ray each had two hits and an RBI as Bristol zipped up four early runs which made all the difference in the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the regular season, the Merchants had one more week, five total games, to make its push for the GTHBL regular season title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had dates against Foss, the Rising Stars, Mr. G’s, and People’s to end the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray generated four hits, including an RBI single to win it, as Bristol defeated Foss in a 6-3 10 inning war from Manchester on July 20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amazingly, Strahowski went the full 10 innings – striking out 10 – to post the incredible victory for the Merchants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Peters had a critical two-RBI double in the tenth for a little insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol quickly swept Hartford on July 21 - winning games by scores of 12-0 and 7-0 to go to 18-7 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was ‘Joe Parlante’ Day in Bristol as he collected five hits and eight RBI over the two games versus the Rising Stars from Muzzy Field, leading to blowout victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hasler and Archibald drew the victories on the mound for the locals, each throwing five innings over the two shutout efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ProCare and Vernon were both in first place at 14-5 but still had several games to make up while Bristol hanging in at third place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That all changed as Bristol battled at People’s on July 26.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With first place and the regular season championship on the line (that wasn’t a known fact at game-time), the Merchants defeated People’s Bank 1-0 from Trinity College in Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrett drove in the game-winning run while Fuller won the game from the hill to post Bristol to its 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;victory of the campaign</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went the distance with nine strikeouts as did People’s outstanding ace, John Skinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants’ finished the regular season at 20-7 which was good for a first place tie for the league’s regular season title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol tied ProCare and Vernon for the regular season championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then to start the playoffs, Bristol belted the East Hartford Aeros (2-1) on August 4 and Simsbury (4-1) two days later to stay in the GHTBL winner’s bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Simsbury, Mitchell had the go-ahead hit, Cone added two hits while Hasler threw six innings to take the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald earned the save for his one frame of relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on August 8, Bristol fell to People’s by a 3-1 final but rebounded to beat the Vernon Orioles (4-1) on August 9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parlante had a critical two-run double while Macellaro singled home the game-winning tally for Bristol against the Orioles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, later that day, the Merchants had to battle People’s again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And People’s won the rematch 6-2 as Bristol ended the season at 23-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hewey, Peters, Parlante, Macellaro, and Ray were all named GBHTL All-Star First Team while Hasler won the Kyle Valentine Award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, TBE will take a look at an exciting 2007 campaign and more championships to follow.</p>
