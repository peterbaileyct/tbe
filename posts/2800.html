<p>The Bristol Water and Sewer Department is asking residents to voluntarily follow an odd/even watering policy, as the city’s reservoirs have dropped below 70 percent capacity, the mayor's office announced in a press release earlier today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Odd/even watering asks residents with an even street number to water on even days of the month and those with odd street numbers to water on odd days of the month. The policy applies to washing cars, watering flowers and any other non-essential outside uses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, the capacity in Bristol reservoirs fell to 68 percent, 2 percent lower than the trigger of 70 percent, according to the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Water Department has triggers in its Emergency Response Plan that require specific actions, including issuing a notice when their reservoirs fall to certain percentages, the release said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first trigger is a drought alert, which goes into effect between July and December if the reservoir levels fall below 75 percent capacity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When this occurs, staff begin preparations for a drought. Bristol initiated its drought advisory in June, in anticipation of drought conditions, when levels were at or above 75 percent, according to the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that time, Bristol Sewer and Water Department Superintendent Robert J. Longo asked city departments for their cooperation in reducing water use at their facilities, the release said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daily monitoring of reservoirs will continue, but without rain, mandatory restrictions are likely to follow, said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu in the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone with questions on the restrictions or the City’s water supply can contact the Bristol Water and Sewer Department at 860-582-7431. </p>

<p>Information on the Voluntary Restrictions along with other ways to conserve water can also be found on the Bristol Water Department website at <a href="http://www.bristolwaterdept.org">www.bristolwaterdept.org</a> or on the Bristol Water and Sewer Department’s and Mayor’s Office Facebook pages.         </p>
