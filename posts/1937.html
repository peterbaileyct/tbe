<p>Standing tall on a knoll in Bristol's hilly West Cemetery is the Soldiers Monument engraved with the names of the men from Bristol that fought and died in the Civil War. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Josiah Tracy Peck, a prominent Bristol resident at the time, conceived the idea of a monument.  Through the generosity of donations by the citizens of Bristol, the funds were raised for its construction and James G. Batterson of Hartford was tapped to build a 35’ tall obelisk with a brownstone eagle as the crown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dedication ceremony and exercises occurred on a warm spring day in 1866, making it one of the oldest Civil War monuments in Connecticut.&nbsp; Each side of the monument is inscribed with the battles Bristol soldiers participated, and the names of those men who made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The name of the youngest soldier etched on the monument is Adna E. Nichols, who died as a prisoner of war in Andersonville, GA, in August of 1864 at the age of 16.</p>
