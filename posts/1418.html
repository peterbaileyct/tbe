<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">One-hundred</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">year</span> <span data-contrast="auto">old Deacon Joseph Hudson Sr. was the center of the local NAACP chapter’s annual Black History Month Celebration, “A Piece of African-American History,” </span><span data-contrast="auto">held </span><span data-contrast="auto">at the Bridge Community Church building on School St. this past Saturday.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The celebration featured an hour-long conversation with Hudson, moderated by his son, Joseph Hudson Jr., an historical presentation about area blacks, comments from NAACP members, and the presentations of proclamations from the city and state as well as tw</span><span data-contrast="auto">o other acknowledgments, including one from local veterans recognizing his years in the military.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Looking fit and exhibiting a fine sense of humor, the elder Hudson discussed with his son, his arrival in Bristol in 1946, his accomplishments playing in what was then the </span><span data-contrast="auto">farm teams of the Negro</span><span data-contrast="auto"> baseball</span><span data-contrast="auto"> league</span><span data-contrast="auto">, his employment with Bristol Brass, his involvement with local churches, several of which he helped found, including St. James in New Britain and AME Beulah in Bristol.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The senior Hudson spoke in a low voice</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and apologized several times for messing things up because, as he said, it was difficult to remember the details of what happened 50 years ago or so.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">His son carried most of the conversation, providing a conte</span><span data-contrast="auto">x</span><span data-contrast="auto">t for the life of his father, and handing the microphone to his father at different times during the conversation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Some of the discussion was fun, as when the junior Hudson recalled his father taking him to </span><span data-contrast="auto">Ebbetts</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Field in Brooklyn to watch Jackie Robinson play, hoping to see what made Robinson so special and hoping to see him steal home</span><span data-contrast="auto">, which he did, and to which the junior Hudson recalled his father expressing satisfaction, saying, “Good” and "We been doing that all the time."</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">
</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The elder Hudson was a highly skilled baseball talent, who was sought after by </span><span data-contrast="auto">the Bristol Brass </span><span data-contrast="auto">factory team for his prowess on the field</span><span data-contrast="auto">. On a trip to Auburn, the junior Hudson said, a former coach told him his father had the stuff to make professional baseball if the leagues had not been s</span><span data-contrast="auto">egregated.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Several times, </span><span data-contrast="auto">the</span> <span data-contrast="auto">elder Hudson </span><span data-contrast="auto">remarked that he had to turn down playing for the team because his work hours conflicted with game times, and he reiterated that work was a priority.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Other parts of the conversation covered the day to day life of the family, friends and fellow church goers. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Church was a significant factor in the elder Hudson’s life, but he was a Baptist and there wasn’t a Baptist church in the area, so he ended up playing cards every Thursday night with members of the Methodist church.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">He attended the c</span><span data-contrast="auto">ard nights, every other </span><span data-contrast="auto">Thursday, </span><span data-contrast="auto">setting aside the mandatory $5 to play</span><span data-contrast="auto">, that is until, the Baptists founded a church of their own and asked him to be a deacon, which ended his attendance at card night.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">More harrowing were the memories of family trips back South at a time when there were no major routes, such as Rt. 95</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and blacks were not allowed to eat at most establishments in the small towns they traveled through, nor allowed to sleep at hotels along the way. It wasn’t unusual to ask a gas station owner if the family could park the car and sleep on the premises. Sometimes food could be purchase</span><span data-contrast="auto">d</span><span data-contrast="auto">, if only at the back door. One exception was the Blue Robin hotel cha</span><span data-contrast="auto">in</span><span data-contrast="auto"> which was black owned and considered a sanctuary of sorts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The junior Hudson also shared a few stories from his school days, attending Ellen P. Hubbell and Mary A. Callen schools, when he often</span><span data-contrast="auto"> ended up in fights, or even as the butt of jokes, including when the student sang school-sanctioned songs, such as </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">Old Black Joe,</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> which inevitably ended with the white students pointing a finger at him as the refrain came to the words, </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">old black Joe.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Another part of the discussion covered the reintroduction of a local NAACP chapter in 1968, during which time </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">minister from </span><span data-contrast="auto">a white church </span><span data-contrast="auto">and the priest </span><span data-contrast="auto">who became the principal of S</span><span data-contrast="auto">t. Paul Catholic High School, supported the effort</span><span data-contrast="auto">. The memory </span><span data-contrast="auto">caused the junior Hudson to pause as he was overcome with emotion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">As part of the program, Gail Williams from Plainville presented a slideshow </span><span data-contrast="auto">based on h</span><span data-contrast="auto">er own research and other research, much of it produced by the late Barbara Hudson, a daughter of the senior Hudson.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Among the revelations was that the African slaves from the Amistad traveled through Plainville to and from their way to court in Hartford prior to being freed. Williams also </span><span data-contrast="auto">brought up </span><span data-contrast="auto">a KKK </span><span data-contrast="auto">rally held </span><span data-contrast="auto">in Plainville in 1980, which drew national attention, and resulted in the appearance of then-NAACP president Roger Wilkins</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span> <span data-contrast="auto">who spoke in H</span><span data-contrast="auto">artford.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Much of the research, and Barbara Hudson</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">s Freedom Trail Grant Report for the Bristol Historical Society, were printed in the program. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Mayor Ellen </span><span data-contrast="auto">Zoppo-Sassu</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (D) presented the proclamation from the city, and offered an open invitation </span><span data-contrast="auto">to </span><span data-contrast="auto">anyone interested in accessing Bristol Historical Society archives, which include those of the Bristol Press, to encourage further research into </span><span data-contrast="auto">the history of </span><span data-contrast="auto">Bristol’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">blacks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Rep. Whit Betts (</span><span data-contrast="auto">R) presented a proclamation from the state legislature.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Veteran Tim Gamache</span><span data-contrast="auto">, representing the Bristol Veterans Council, </span><span data-contrast="auto">performed a coining ceremony, where a coin from the veterans’ association was presented to the senior Hudson via a handshake and then a salute from Gamache. The senior Hudson served in the armed forces from 1942-1946 and served in Germany, France, Italy and the Philippines. He was among the first U.S. soldiers to liberate the concentration camp at Auschwitz.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Patty Floyd Bent</span><span data-contrast="auto">ley</span><span data-contrast="auto"> presented a plague from a local business, African </span><span data-contrast="auto">Heritage Collection</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">In closing remarks, Tim </span><span data-contrast="auto">Camerl</span><span data-contrast="auto"> spoke briefly, challenging the members of the audience to remember their forerunners in the civi</span><span data-contrast="auto">l</span><span data-contrast="auto"> rights movement and how today their example needs to be respected and followed. If people forget their history, they may find themselves without direction because the past, while not always a positive thing, provides a compass for those who follow, he said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">In addition, he pressed people to be positive even in times where it might appear to be impossible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Finally, he said, that with just one tenth of the resolve and mission of the people who began the civil rights movement, people today could </span><span data-contrast="auto">effect</span><span data-contrast="auto"> monumental change.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Pastor Irene Singleton of Tower of Hope Christian Ministries which holds services at the Bri</span><span data-contrast="auto">dge Community building provided the invocation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Lexie Mangum, president of the local NAACP chapter, kicked off the celebration and conclude the event with the announcement that the local NAACP chapter will officially </span><span data-contrast="auto">opened</span><span data-contrast="auto"> its new offices on Saturday, March 2, at 55 South St. All are welcome.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>
