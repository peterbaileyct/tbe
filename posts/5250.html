<p>BURLINGTON – The Bristol Eastern softball squad made a big comeback at Lewis Mills on Monday, scoring three runs in the top of the seventh, as the Lancers snared a huge 9-8 road win in Burlington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory evened Eastern’s ledger at 2-2 while Mills fell to 3-4 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a wild and wacky game as Eastern scored the first five runs in the contest before eventually allowing the Spartans a 7-6 edge through five innings of play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers notched five runs in the third to pick up a 5-0 push, temporarily taking control of the showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Mills dropped a five-spot of its own in the bottom of the frame to make it a 5-5 contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Eastern scored a run in the fourth while the Spartans cashed in on two in the bottom of the fifth to scoop up a 7-6 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither squad scored in the sixth but in the top of the seventh, the Lancers secured the lead for good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Riley Giblin dropped in a game-tying double while Alex Shorette (2-for-3) tallied a go-ahead two-base hit to help Eastern secure an 8-7 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for a little insurance, Makayla Antunes (2-for-4, three RBI) slipped in the eventual game-winning RBI single as Eastern nabbed a 9-7 edge with just half-an-inning to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills added a run in the bottom of the seventh stanza but could not generate another game-tying drive as the Lancers ramped up a big 9-8 victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern Ali Tellier survived a five-error performance from the visitors, tallying a dozen strikeouts to earn the win on the mound. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ali struck out 12 in the circle and helped out a shaky defense,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman via Twitter. “The grit of Riley Giblin [must be noted], toughing out an injury to get on the field in the seventh and [help] secure the victory. Hats off to a gutsy Mills team who battled all game.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hailey Gorack struck out 10 for the home team but the outfit absorbed a very tough loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jasmine Perez, playing extremely well for the Lancers this year, went 2-for-4 while Shorette and Antunes each collected two hits apiece.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Samantha Policki added a hit while Jazmyn Browne scored two runs over the winning effort. Catcher Janessa Gonzalez made several outstanding plays behind the plate – making a big catch on a foul ball and later threw out a runner to keep the Spartans at bay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the CIAC website, Eastern’s next game is on Wednesday at home against Middletown (3:45 p.m.) on the Alumni Field turf. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the Lancers do not have a turf-built softball field (yet), Eastern will instead be playing the contest from its usual grass field across from the playground at Page Park.&nbsp;</p>
