<p>In the course of a long life, my father had many things to tell me. Some were wise, some were cruel, some were loving, some were funny, but all were memorable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let me preface this story with the fact that my father loved his three children unconditionally, but parents born in the year 1910 had a different way of showing it and saying it than the parents of today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be evident that not too many of these quotes are ever spoken today. (Some might get you arrested.) Society has changed, but I'm not sure that parenthood is any better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a short and certainly incomplete list of things he often said to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><u>On the topic of histor</u></strong>y</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“When I was your age, we didn’t own boots.&nbsp;I walked to school, two miles every day, barefoot, in the snow, uphill, both ways.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When I was your age, we picked coal off the railroad tracks to heat the house. And you think <strong><em>you’re cold?”</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“Do you think I was born yesterday? No one believes that story.”</p>

<p>“That lawn isn’t going to mow itself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That sidewalk isn’t going to shovel itself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You don’t even know the meaning of unfair. Get to work."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><u>On the topic of dinner etiquette</u></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Get your elbow off the table.&nbsp;Were you born in a barn?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You will not leave that table until every lima bean is off that plate. You sit there until they’re all gone.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><u>On the topic of discipline</u></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s been a long time since I’ve had to take this belt off.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re crying?  I’ll give you something to really cry about.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Don’t ever tell me your teacher isn’t fair.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I brought you into this world. I can also take you out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><u>On the topic of geography</u></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s always faster coming home from Maine than going there. Look at the map. It’s all uphill going there and all downhill coming home.”</p>

<h3><strong><u>On the topic of punctuality</u></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Get in the car! It’s 9 o'clock, and we’re going to be late for 9:30 Mass. (St. Joseph Church was five minutes away.)</p>

<p>Now that you have seen some of my father’s greatest hits, let me give you a little background of his life. Although he technically did not qualify as a member of “The Greatest Generation," he certainly was a great man to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Krampitz, Mickey to his friends, was born in 1910 to two German immigrants who came to America in the early 1900’s. His father came over first and found a job, and then he sent for his wife and four children to come over after he was settled.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the boat trip to Ellis Island, the family’s baby daughter died during the trip, leaving three boys in the early Krampitz family. Mrs. Krampitz then proceeded to have three more boys, one of them my father, making the final total six. Both parents spoke no English when they arrived, but his father did land a job at Sessions Foundry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1914, when my father was 4-years old, his father was hit by a car and died, leaving his mother a widow with little English proficiency, no job, and six young sons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result of the death of his father, Mickey and his brothers were expected to become the bread winners of the family. He never got beyond the eighth grade, quitting school and traveling to New York to become a baker’s apprentice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He eventually got back to Bristol, got a job at New Departure, and learned the trade of plumbing.&nbsp;He kept the job at New Departure until his retirement in 1970.&nbsp;But during his working years, he always worked a second job. The one I remember best is he became a salesman for The World Book Encyclopedia, going door-to door in Bristol and neighboring towns, telling people how crucial the World Book was to their child’s education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When my parents were first married, my father brought his mother-in-law, my grandmother, into their home, because that is what people did in 1938. He took care of her like she was his own mother. They had my two sisters in the early 1940's, and lived in two-family houses as renters for the first 10 years of their marriage. I was born in 1952, a <strong>big mistake</strong> 10 years after my sisters' births, but my parents thought I was pretty special nonetheless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My father and mother were determined that their children would have an easier and better life than theirs. And they succeeded, putting three children through college by working themselves to the bone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My father was certainly not a perfect human being. He had flaws, some serious ones. But he always loved his family. He always made time to see his kids play in the band or perform in  school plays. He never missed a parent-teacher conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t know if he ever missed one of my baseball, basketball or football games. He would leave work early to see us in our activities. As most parents are prone, he thought we were better than we actually were. “Why can’t that coach see that you are better than ________? “, was one of his frequent observations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;But also, back then, he followed the code, and never said a word about his criticisms to anyone but me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mickey Krampitz had a life that almost anyone could consider a success, but he carried with him forever doubts about his own worthiness. He died in 1995 at the age of 85.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will repeat again. Dad, you did your best. You <strong>were </strong>great. Happy Father’s Day.</p>
