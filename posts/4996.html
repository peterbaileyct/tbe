<p><strong>“</strong>Construction activities began in June of 2020, with the project scheduled for road opening by November of 2020,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu.  “Temporary paving was installed for the winter with final paving scheduled for May.  A completion date of June, 2021 is anticipated due to environmental scheduling constraints, and complications due to the pandemic.”  <br><br>“Detours are being put in place at the Louisiana Avenue Bridge as they recommence construction. Bridge closure will begin the 13<sup>th</sup> of April 2021 for approximately one month,” stated Councilwoman Mary Fortier, who represents the District and serves on the Public Works Board. “Your cooperation in avoiding the area during the duration of the project is appreciated.”</p>
