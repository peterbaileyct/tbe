<p>Bristol Central’s boys soccer team extended their winning streak with a tough 2-1 victory over a determined Plainville team. <br><br>The Rams created many chances in the first half but struggled to put shots on goal. <br></p>

<p>They carried much of the play and were swarming around the Plainville goal, but could not break through until Rafael Antonio scored his first career varsity goal late in the first half. <br><br>Plainville outplayed Central for much of the second half and tied the game up with about 15 minutes left. <br></p>

<p>But the lead was short lived when Mark Palma scored on a perfect free kick from right outside the 18 yard-box to net the game winner with under 10 minutes remaining. </p>

<p><br>Overall, BC struggled to gain momentum in the second half and were on their heels for much of it. Once again, the Rams defensive effort was solid. Beckett Hennessey and Michael Allen were standouts defensively in helping limit Plainville to just a few quality chances, and in helping to preserve the win after Palma's late goal.<br></p>
