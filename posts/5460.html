<p>WINDSOR – After a tough loss at home to Southington in their previous game, the Bristol Eastern baseball squad was blasted by Windsor on Monday, falling by a 15-0 final in five innings from Barry Chasen Ballpark in a CCC Interdivisional tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor moved to 9-3 overall while Eastern fell to 2-11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was limited to just three hits in the game, all singles, as the Warriors had eight hits – scoring several times off unearned runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor starting pitcher Clark Churchill nabbed the victory for his squad, allowing Ryan Fradette, Trevor Nohilly and Jaydon Churchill singles as the only offense generated by the Kingstreeters that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill and reliever Isaac Rosario combined for eight strikeouts and issued just one walk over five innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nohilly and Jayden Churchill generated their hits in the third inning, the best chance for the Lancers to notch a run, but the visitors never put a dent on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor scored two in the first frame off Jayden Churchill, who earned the start for the Lancers on the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the first pitch of the game, Windsor leadoff hitter Breon Parker singled to left and after one out, Rosario homered over the fence in right-center to push the Warriors’ edge to a 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern kept Windsor off the board in the second frame, threatened in the third, but then fell behind by eight runs at the completion of the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor sent eleven batters to the&nbsp;plate in the third, scoring six times – with just one run being earned – to snare an 8-0 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors tallied only three hits in the inning but took advantage of two errors, two base-on-balls with one batter getting plunked by a pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth frame, Windsor batted around one more time and scored seven unearned runs with just three hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A three-run homer by Jeremy Blackwood was one of the three hits for the home squad that inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern committed two costly errors and relief pitchers Tyler Martin and Nohilly allowed a combined four walks while hitting two batters as the Lancers fell by 15 runs in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are back in action on Wednesday as Eastern travels to Sage Park for a CCC South encounter against Berlin at 6:30 p.m.</p>
