<p>WEST HARTFORD - After a tough extra-inning loss to Bristol Eastern on Thursday, how would the Bristol Central softball respond in a CCC Interdivisional challenge against Conard on Friday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program turned in a victory of course as the Rams defeated the Chieftains by a 7-3 final from Conard high school in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central improved to 6-3 on the season while Conard dropped to 5-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams got a huge contribution from Leah Sklenka as she went 2-for-3 at the plate which included two runs scored, a stolen base and two RBI over a complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Sophia Torreso made contributions on both sides of the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sophomore belted out a double, scored two runs and added an RBI while earning the victory in the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso threw a four-hitter to lead Central in the winning endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[The] defense was solid all afternoon,” said Central coach Monica Hayes via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have a full slate of games next week, starting on Monday with a CCC Interdivisional tilt versus Wethersfield at 4 p.m. in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central remains at home on Wednesday against Middletown in a CCC South confrontation at 3:45 and then on Friday, it’s a trip to the Dunn Sports Complex in Meriden against CCC South foe Maloney at 7 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central baseball bounced back as well</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the baseball team picked up a big win against Simsbury, putting together a 4-0 shutout over the Trojans on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central head coach Bunty Ray reported that star chucker Mike Lorenzetti picked up 17 strikeouts while allowing Simsbury one hit over another dominating exhibition from the 6-foot-8 senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also blasted out a two-run double as Central won big from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming week, the baseball squad from Central will play there times with all games commencing at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
