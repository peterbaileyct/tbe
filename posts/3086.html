<p>The Bristol Edition welcomes Mike Letendre, local sports writer with roots back to the late 1990's. Most recently Letendre had been covering sports for a local weekly, the Bristol Observer, that pulled out of Bristol with the onset of COVID-19. Almost 20 years ago Letendre worked for a local upstart, Bristol Today, run by TBE's David Fortier, the late Dave Lepore and Dawn Leger. Letendre joins Jack Krampitz, TBE contributing editor and sports editor, and Fortier for a Sunday morning conversation about their plans for covering local teams during COVID.</p>
