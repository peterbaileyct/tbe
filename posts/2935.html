<p>“We worked hard throughout the game,” said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. &nbsp;“We missed some chances, but overall the tie reflected the balance between the teams. We were uneven but willing throughout. &nbsp;Avon was a solid team with good speed and 10 seniors starting. &nbsp; We did a good job thwarting their attack for much of the game. &nbsp; If we had hit a few of our shots (we outshot them 10-6, including hitting the post in the second half), we would have won."</p>
