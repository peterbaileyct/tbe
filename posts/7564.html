<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is it time for a shot clock for scholastic hoops in Connecticut?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CIAC could add a shot clock for basketball as soon as the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Federation of State High School Associations has given its approval for a shot clock in Connecticut and its use will change scholastic hoops in our state forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are both pros and cons when it comes to adding something of that nature to the game of basketball.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it opens a can of worms in terms of scoreboard operation, game logistics, and training – not to mention the added cost – for the endeavor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you want to see a shot clock at the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium over at Bristol Central or from the Thomas M. Monahan Gym on the campus of Bristol Eastern?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of our athletes in our city play AAU basketball and will be competing collegiately so why not incorporate the shot clock at the high school level right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a couple schools of thought on this riveting subject.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Good&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good point was raised by Bristol Eastern Athletic Coordinator (or whatever he calls himself nowadays) John Stavens. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thirty-five seconds at the high school level makes sense,” said Stavens via Twitter. “For kids who have a good travel or AAU background entering high school, it's the appropriate step for their development.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s an excellent take by Stavens whose daughter, Emma, plays on the girls varsity basketball team at Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where she could be headed in the sport, she’ll be seeing a lot of shot clocks by the time Emma is finished at Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s invaluable experience for her to get used to a shot clock at the scholastic level.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Necessary&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My first non-Bristol basketball assignment for the Bristol Press in 2001 had me traveling to Lewis Mills in Burlington as the Spartans took on Wamago in a Berkshire League tilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first time around, Wamago was dusted by Mills and 1,000-point scoring machine Tim Russell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the rematch in Burlington, what did Wamogo do?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They played the stall game - attempting to keep the high-scoring Russell in check.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For two-minutes at a clip, and with the visitors in control on offense, everyone (players, referee, cheerleaders, and fans) simply watched Wamogo just stand with the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Russell and company stood there helplessly as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, it was boring.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Russell still popped off for 21 points in Mills’ 43-41&nbsp;<em>triple overtime&nbsp;</em>win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did that strategy pay off for Wamogo?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It did not and there have been several other local examples of schools choosing the stall to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2007, Howie Hewitt and his Maloney boys basketball squad pulled the same thing against Farmington to open the fourth quarter of a nip-and-tuck game from Wilby High School in Waterbury during a Class L semifinal state tournament showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Maloney put the ball in play off a near six-minute stall, the Spartans immediately dribbled the ball out of bounds. Maloney did win the game in the end, 45-37.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those might be extreme situations but a shot clock would prevent that kind of tomfoolery from occurring in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What about learning the game at a ‘snail’s pace’&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But at this point, aren’t the kids – the student athletes – still learning the game?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why speed things up?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is high school basketball and some of the athletes need the extra reps on a single possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t run a motion offense right on a certain play, for instance, go for it again and start from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is subtracting time from the game the correct fit for this level?  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a lot of people in favor of a shot clock have never played in a game with one in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a big deal in terms in wanting the use of one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Coach Redeye fell asleep…again&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isn’t running the actual scoreboard at these scholastic games hard enough as it is?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, you’ll need someone different to run the shot clock that will take additional time, training, and effort that a short preseason worth of games won’t provide enough training for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isn’t bad enough that we sometimes see Bristol Eastern girls soccer coach Scott Redman falling asleep at the wheel of the game clock (or was that Mr. Jim Tetro?).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh look, the Bristol Eastern/Avon boys basketball game is going on and the clock has been stuck on 3:47 for the last twenty-minutes…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one time, when Redman was falling asleep and drooling on the scoreboard control pad, I swear I saw sparks fly from it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That could cause a fire!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And doesn’t Jason ‘Coachie’ DeCarolis have enough to do at Bristol Central basketball games?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about his game-night ‘rituals.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He must get the players’ names for introductions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coachie must tell the fans to kindly remove their hats for the National Anthem.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there’s ‘First horn’…then ‘Second horn’ (if we gave him a chance, think ‘Coachie’ would say ‘Third horn’ as well?!?).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, does he have to run the shot clock as well?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a shot clock is adopted, I think Coachie should be on the microphone to count down all thirty-five seconds!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bottom line is the scorers’ table is a busy place and another piece of technology makes a tough job even tougher. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Human&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accidents will happen because we’re all human, but why incorporate something like that in the first place?  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then if a shot attempt comes near or after the shot clock has expired, you want a JV caliber referee to make a game-losing decision because the officials didn’t see the play?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t those refs have enough to do as well?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those guys are going to have to be trained as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if there is a malfunction on the clock, the referees will be guessing about the time to put back on the scoreboard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a close game with critical seconds left to play, what a horrible situation to be in…for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is truly a jump-ball when it comes to a shot clock.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pros and cons are both interesting and noteworthy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether or not the CIAC will try to implement a shot clock next year should prove interesting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, either way, let’s all just hope coach Redman stays awake if he’s on the shot clock…</p>
