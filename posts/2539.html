<p>Last year, the Task Force created public service announcements to help reduce the stigma around opioid misuse and to combat the opioid epidemic. Local media production company MazzMedia &nbsp;produced a series of 1-2 minute vignettes, using often emotional commentary by those affected by the opioid public health crisis. The 16-part series debuted on social media outlets last winter.</p>
