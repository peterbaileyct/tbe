What has been bothering me about our local government, under the current mayor, are two things.

First, how are decisions being made?

Second, who is making the decisions?

(May just want to focus on one of these, and write to two pieces in quick succession.)

Who is the number one question. Primary.

First, how things are supposed to happen.

What actually is happening.

Leave people with something concrete to think about. (Do I cite any of the people I have been reading?)

Include a map that depicts this: how it should happen, how it is happening? Use what software?
