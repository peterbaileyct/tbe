<p>With 2 minutes left in the half, Emma Stavens fought off three  Mills players, won possession and played a great ball to Ciara Collins. Collins beat a defender and attacked the goal. Lewis Mills goalkeeper Resmije Bylykbashi (4 saves) was up to the task, deflecting the blast from Collins. However, Lili Morneault was crashing hard and buried the rebound in the back of the empty net to equalize the score heading into halftime. </p>
