<p>Bristol’s 2020 Little League baseball spring season was canceled in May, but Bristol Girl’s Little League Softball (BGLLS) are on the verge of committing to a 2020 season. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pending any interruptions or last minute restrictions placed on a Phase 2 reopening, BGLLS will begin playing games July 6 with the City Series scheduled August 31 – September 4 (September 5, if necessary). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The 2020 Spring Season is currently suspended, but with guidance from the city and state, we are prepared to resume the ‘spring season’ in July,” league president Adam Whitlock told The Bristol Edition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Should the season start, BGLLS expects to host nearly 200 games in Bristol, including the always competitive and popular city series.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naturally, there are safety concerns to take into consideration, but the league has taken further measures beyond the guidance provided by Little League International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have purchased additional health and cleaning supplies, and are prepared to operationally support the recommendations and best practices shared by the softball community in additional to practices the city and state recommend,” Whitlock said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some travel leagues are modifying their rules for safety concerns such as relocating the home plate umpire behind the pitcher and moving the catcher further off the plate, Whitlock said he does not anticipate the rules that govern the game changing dramatically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since its inception in 2008 when it had a handful of teams and players, the league has grown significantly.  With more than 210 players registered for the 2020 season and 19 teams spread out over five divisions (Tee Ball, Coach Pitch, Minor, Major, Junior and Senior), registration is at an all-time high. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And currently, online registration remains open with the numbers expected to grow as the city and state suspend restrictions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In over six weeks between January and March, more than 130 young athletes participated in the league’s winter clinics, dedicating three days a week to their training (hitting, fielding and pitching).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A great deal of preparation goes into all youth sports leagues without a pandemic to contend with and none of that is lost on Whitlock, who has been president for six years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> “We have the unique challenge of supporting the game for more than 200 young ladies in this city, and playing host to nearly the same number of participants from visiting towns," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Without the city’s support, we would not be able to facilitate the game of play. &nbsp;Their leadership, support and guidance has been especially appreciated as we collectively navigate through unfamiliar times.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The uniforms have arrived, the equipment is cleaned, the fields are in great shape, the umpires remain committed, the volunteers are set to go and Connecticut’s phase 2 reopening date was moved up three days to June 17.  Alas, there is hope.</p>
