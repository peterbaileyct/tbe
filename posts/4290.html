<p>As the scholastic winter sports season is finally arriving - in terms of basketball and boys swimming at least - the upcoming schedule has some intriguing city series games coming up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In boys and girls hoop, Central and Eastern square off for the first time on February 12 in the first of two meetings in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in term of girls action, the Lancers are on quite a winning streak against the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though that streak is not as long as BE’s domination over BC in volleyball, Central last defeated Eastern in basketball back in 2004.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will that streak carry into 2021?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps, but that one-sided domination wasn’t always the case between the schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just over a quarter-century ago, the rivalry between the two public programs in the city was competitive, fierce, and the contests usually went down to the wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on January 31, 1994, Central and Eastern each had outstanding teams and duked it out against one another for the first time that season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of state rankings, Eastern came into the tilt against Central as a top ten squad - anchored by two sensational seniors, Jessica Byrnes and Tricia Tycz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo were the remaining players from the Lancers last state championship squad in 1991 and the seniors, who each could do a little of everything on the hardwood, led the team at an outstanding 9-2 ledger going into the city series clash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coach Tony Floyd’s roster had several juniors including sharp-shooter Bevin Borajkiewicz, forward Bevin Shappy, and guard Jess Rajotte.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also seeing action that evening was future Keene State softball star Beth Ponte and reserve guards Amy Blakley and Gina Plourde.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central entered the game at 9-3 overall and had several talented players on its squad, coached by Gary Fleming (who is probably happy that the TBE isn’t taking about the BC/BE volleyball rivalry this week…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting up front for the Rams was senior Heather Whitehead (Central Connecticut State University), who would run over anything on the court that didn’t wear a Bristol Central uniform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At nearly 5-foot-10, she was a double-double machine and one of the best players the CCC South had to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was Ernestine Austin, a jack-of-all-trades sophomore that ended up scoring a combined 1,000-plus points between Central and Eastern (she transferred to Eastern as a senior) before heading off to Syracuse and later, the University of Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also contributing to the Rams’ cause over the 1993-94 campaign were Amanda Austin, a talented junior guard, senior Jill Nocera, senior Misse Parker, sophomore Jane Bialosuknia, Sarah Killiany, Gayle Zahnke and Jill Porrini among other players that helped add depth to Central’s bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest went back-and-forth with Central leading after one completed frame, then trailed at the half before looking up at a 43-37 deficit through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But fourth quarter heroics by Central doomed Eastern as the Rams racked up a thrilling 60-51 victory from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Austin made critical steals late, the Lancers couldn’t buy a free throw throughout the contest and a balanced Central offensive attack led to doom and demise for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whitehead - helping to fuel a 23-8 fourth period run with eight points - led all scorers with 18 points and a game-high 10 rebounds - while Amanda Austin zipped in 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ernestine Austin dropped in nine points, Porrini tallied eight while Parker netted four to help the home standing Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tycz led the Lancers 16 points, four rebounds, six assists and two steals while Byrnes supplied 14 points, six rebounds, three assists and a team-leading five steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borajkiewicz scored 14 points to go along with three rebounds, and three assists, Shappy added five points and a team best eight rebounds while Blakley also scored a hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was a time in scholastic history when Eastern wasn’t a big time user of the three-point line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borajkiewicz was known to bury a 3-point field goal every other game but two years later, the Lancers’ program tallied just one 3-pointer <em>all season long</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was the free throw shooting, by both squads, that made Shaquille O’Neal - one of the worst foul shooters in NBA history - look like a superior marksmen from the charity stripe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central went 7-of-18 from the foul line while Eastern faltered to an uninspiring 8-of-21 - missing four of its five attempts over the final eight minutes of action that could have slowed down the Rams’ game-ending run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six different players for Central netted a hoop over the first period as the Rams nabbed a 16-11 edge through one completed frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in a blistering second quarter of play, Tycz and Byrnes dropped in a combined 15 points as Eastern assumed control of the showdown, leading 31-28 at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borajkiewicz scored five of Eastern’s 12 third quarter points as Eastern nabbed a six-point edge (43-37) with one frame to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Midway through the final period, Eastern held a 46-42 push but Central quickly made it’s game-winning run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams outscored the Lancers 18-5 to finish the showdown and as Central ended the final quarter with a 23-point explosion, the home team came away with a huge nine-point win to move to 10-3 overall and 5-2 in CCC South play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 9-3 overall (4-2 CCC South) off the losing engagement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads finished the year by hosting Class LL state tournament games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 13 Central end the year falling to No. 20 Rockville by a 47-43 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, ranked 11th in the LL field, defeated No. 22 Fairfield (46-34) in first round play before bowing out to No. 6 Manchester, 65-50, to finish the season.</p>
