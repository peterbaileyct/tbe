<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past week, the Bristol American Legion baseball program got pretty sick and tired of the weather.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a ridiculous stretch for the program as Post 2 was only able to get one game in – an 11-1 triumph over Simsbury last Sunday to hang in second place of the Zone 1 standings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point a week ago, Bristol had played 3-4 more Zone 1 games than every other team in the league.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But by the completion of this weekend, most teams will have caught up – for good or bad – in terms of standings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after Bristol belted Simsbury, a slew of postponements killed off the rest of the week for Post 2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thursday’s contest against West Hartford was postponed, starting an unfortunate pattern to the week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That contest, which could decide the Zone 1 winner, has been switched to Muzzy Field on July 28.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that pivotal showdown, Bristol will be the visiting team like it was in last week’s make-up against Naugatuck.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then this past Friday, a brief rain shower dumped buckets on Muzzy Field – putting the infield area behind third base under water. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Groundskeepers and umpires took a close look at the situation, a sizable puddle, as both teams looked on, hoping to get the game in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But ten minutes after the scheduled start time, the game was called.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the cherry on the sundae was finding out that Sunday’s game at Avon was, like everything that week, POSTPONED.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its place, Naugatuck travels to Avon for a 5:30 p.m. Zone 1 thriller that did not involve Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, it’s going to be a week before Post 2 finally hits the field – weather permitting of course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scheduled today is Bristol traveling to Newington for a 5 p.m. game from Legends Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It appears that Berlin is coming to Bristol on Monday for a Zone 1 clash at 6:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a game between the two squads scheduled for Tuesday at Sage Park, but the plans for that contest fell through.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a wrap from one of the wackiest weeks of Bristol American Legion Baseball in quite some time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Meriden takes over Zone 1 lead</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad from Meriden has quickly taken control of the Zone 1 standings after beating West Hartford twice on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scores were 1-0 and 4-3 as West Hartford fell in a doubleheader from Ceppa Field in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With those losses, Bristol popped up into second place at 9-4 overall while Meriden is 11-3 - 1.5 games in front of Post 2 for second place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford is now 8-5 and is a game behind Bristol in third place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juniors are rolling now</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Juniors are now the hottest squad in Zone 1, winning three straight games since a 1-6 start.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over its latest win, Post 2 defeated Torrington by a 15-2 final from Fuessenrich Park on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was mercy-ruled after the completion of five innings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill went 4.2 strong innings in posting the victory while Cole Latko mopped up in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is 4-6 with a positive ratio of runs scored-to-runs given up this year (49-to-44).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford remains in first place (8-2) while Bristol is only four games behind that squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 continues to excel on the road, going 4-3 overall, and will be looking to continue its upward trek in the standings.&nbsp;</p>
