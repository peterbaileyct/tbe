<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Bristol Merchants, 2007 was a season of redemption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still one of the top squads in the Greater Hartford Twilight League, the runner-up in 2006 GHTBL playoffs was on a mission to reclaim the tournament championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the 78th season belonged to the Bristol entrant.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The roster turned over a bit -- injuries forced a couple players out of the line-up -- but some of the same, familiar faces were back in the fold.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those new additions found for the squad by head coach Bunty Ray all filled in seamlessly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol squad had either won the regular season or playoff championship over the past three seasons and were going to add to its trophy case by the end of the summer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants lost three starters on the mound from the previous campaign, but pitchers Brian Archibald and Chris Strahowski returned to the rotation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New arms for the Merchants included Kevin Rival, Wendall Anderson, Nick Hudyma and veteran Dave Swanson.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rival was tremendous on the mound, whether starting or coming out of the bullpen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And former Plainville high school standout, Jay Maule, also joined the Bristol contingent -- adding a versatile leadoff man with blazing speed and plenty of power from the plate. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maule was the GHTBL 2006 batting champion and helped set the table for the Bristol line-up that included Nick Macellaro, Adam Peters, Joe Parlante, Rick Hewey, Joel Stamilio, Rick Barrett, and Ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talented youngsters that joined the squad included former Bristol Eastern and Central Connecticut State University standout Sean Allaire, Joe Fortier, Brad Muldoon and Drew Sgro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h4><strong>The GHTBL is split into two divisions that year</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The League was divided into Eastern and Western divisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each team played division opponents three times while crossing over for two games against the other division.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is the division breakdown for 2007:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>West:&nbsp;</strong>Bristol Merchants, Avon Legion, the Hartford Rising Stars, People’s Bank, ProCare of Meriden and Simsbury.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>East:&nbsp;</strong>Glastonbury, East Hartford Jets, East Hartford Aeros, Bill’s Sports Shop (former KGA) of Portland, Vernon Orioles and Foss Insurance of Manchester.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Monaco Ford squad from Glastonbury was a new expansion team in the league.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2007 season included 27 regular season games before the double-elimination tournament commenced at McKenna Field in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the campaign 26-6 overall and after a 3-4 start to the year, the Merchants won 19 straight games -- leading to the regular season title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>The Regular Season</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the first seven games, Bristol simply was on fire and that 3-4 ledger was quickly in the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 20, Bristol was able to even its record at 4-4 with the two-run win at Simsbury, scoring a 3-1 victory in eight innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parlante doubled to open the eighth while Peters knocked him in with an RBI single to left, giving the visiting outfit the lead for good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sgro then added an RBI single to make it 3-1 while Rival struck out the final two batters he faced to earn the save.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald won the game for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight days later, against the Rising Stars from the University of Hartford, Strahowski won behind a six-inning, 10-strikeout effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants ended up securing an 8-1 win on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muldoon added three hits while scoring three runs for the visiting aggression as the Merchants had won six straight games going into the GHTBL’s 10-day Summer break.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol&nbsp;went back to work on July 8 against the Vernon Orioles, earning a 1-0 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win moved Bristol into third place in the GHTBL standings at 10-4.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the seventh stanza, an RBI fielder’s choice by Hewey won it for the Merchants on the road at Henry Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then against the Rising Stars on July 24, Allaire had a no-hitter going into the sixth, eventually picking up a 13-1 win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parlante went 2-of-4 with a home run and three RBI, Peters was also 2-of-4 with a homer and three RBI, Hewey contributed three hits and Ray added two hits (2-for-4) as the Merchants won big.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on July 30, Bristol swept the East Hartford Jets (7-3) and Moncio Ford (7-0) in a doubleheader from Muzzy Field to move to 21-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Bristol’s 18<sup>th</sup> straight victory off the team’s 3-4 start to the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over an amazing three-day event, Bristol <em>finally </em>toppled People’s Bank by a 5-4 final in a marathon 10 innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the competition of the showdown the third time around, the Bristol Merchants were once again crowned the GHTBL regular season champions at 22-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>Postseason</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants went 4-1 over the postseason, starting with a 6-0 victory over Monaco Ford on Aug. 8 from McKenna Park in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four days later, Bristol spun Bill’s Sports Shop (6-5) and then on Aug. 15, it was a winner’s bracket challenge against People’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Swanson came through with a complete-game, five-hit gem as Bristol advanced to the championship round behind the two run win over People’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory was a vintage performance from the veteran Swanson as he struck out five to earn the win over a huge shutout victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first inning, Maule (hit, two runs) walked, got to second on a fielder’s choice, and scored on an RBI base hit by Nick Macellaro to make it a 1-0 contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the sixth, Maule helped to load the bases and eventually scored on a sacrifice fly by Peters as the 2-0 cushion proved to be the final tally of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol lost its only playoff game on Aug. 16, a 2-0 defeat to Vernon as the squad was trying to win the GHTBL postseason title out of the loser’s bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the winner-take-all rematch on Aug. 18, Merchants’ pinch-hitter Adam Peters drilled a two-run single to the gap in right-center field -- breaking a 3-3 tie -- that netted the go-ahead run and propelling Bristol to the championship in a 5-3 win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rival (one earned run, five hits, two walks, six K’s) took the victory over a tremendous effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the campaign at 26-6 -- going 19-1 over its last 20 regular season games and were double winners in the GHTBL once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the fourth consecutive year the Merchants were in the finals, losing to People’s in 2006 which was the only year Bristol did not win the postseason clash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
