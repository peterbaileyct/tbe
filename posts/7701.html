<p>Over the years, the Connecticut Twilight League and Greater Hartford Twilight Leagues have battled it out in an All-Star extravaganza to end the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not counting last year, the GHTBL has never lost the event – going 4-0-1 – as the CTL seemingly couldn’t catch a break.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the most recent All-Star challenge between the squads on August 20, the boys of the CTL finally broke through.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Managed by Bristol Knights’ founder Scott Dickens and coached by the crafty and cunning Chris Barsa (Rockies Coach/CTL Board) and Nico Spuches (Dodgers Coach&nbsp;&amp; Co-Founder), the CTL defeated the GHTBL by a 6-1 final from Palmer Field in Middletown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CTL had a plan with its pitching, mixing it up with several of the best throwers the league had to offer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Everyone played significant time, and all pitchers attending threw at least one inning. The game was to be played American League (MLB) style rules…with a DH,” according to the CTL website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brian Johnson (Brewers, 2-for-2) threw the first three innings for the CTL and allowed a lone unearned run in the bottom of the first inning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be the only run the GHTBL scored that evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Johnson allowed one hit, walked just three and fanned six as he left the contest with a 4-1 lead in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned the victory in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howard Rebhun (Knights, two Ks) fooled the GHTBL batting order with “his deceptive pitching style and sometimes ambidextrous pitching” with an inning of solid relief as the CTL allowed just one hit the rest of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Alicki (Angels), Phil Ledwith (Angels), Ryan Mostoller (Orioles), and Anthony Alicki (Rockies) completely shut down the GHTBL All-Star offensive line-up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on the flip side, the CTL combined for nine hits and went on the attack to open the contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first frame, Luke Johnson (Brewers) was driven in on an RBI single by Kez Douglas (Dodgers, 2-for-3, two BRI) for the CTL’s first run of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a Will Ramos (Rockies, 2-for-2) single, Douglas was driven home on a Georgie Santiago (Knights) sacrifice fly to make it a 2-0 game through a half-inning of action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, Kyle Lentini (Aftershock) led off with a single and Johnson walked with two outs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lentini later scored on a Matt Spang (Orioles) ball that was misplayed and Douglas drove in the other runner with a single to make it a 4-1 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still a three-run game when Rebhun came in the fourth, continuing to dominate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He did what he does best, keeping the batters off balance, and swinging over his breaking pitches,” said the CTL website of Rebhun. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the sixth, Lentini drilled a leadoff homer to make the contest a 5-1 affair.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the ninth, the CTL added an insurance tally to the scoreboard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rob Correia (Dodgers) led off with a walk and scored on a Carter Marshall (Angels) double that made it a 6-1 contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the ninth, Anthony Alicki went back to work and to end the night, Bristol’s Noah Plantamuro fielded one final grounder, tagging second base to end the game, as the CTL won the contest by five runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a true team effort in the win,” said the website. “All the planned pitchers threw great and contributed. All the players in the field made great plays and showed why they were selected.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…Since the first interleague All-Star Game was held in 2015, every exhibition contest has gone down to the wire between the leagues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here’s a quick recap of the last four All-Star game:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*In 2016, the GHTBL won a masterful pitcher’s duel over a 1-0 triumph.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*During the 2017&nbsp;battle, the GHTBL broke a 1-1&nbsp;tie in the ninth to win in the end, 4-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Then in 2018, a back-and-forth showdown at New Britain Stadium ended in a&nbsp;7-7 tie after 10 innings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Finally in 2019, after a 1-1 tie after nine innings, the GHTBL nabbed a 4-1 victory (10 innings).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>MORE NOTES…</strong>The Rocky Hill Rockies went undefeated through the 2021 CTL Playoffs and Championship series, winning four straight games to capture another Connecticut Twilight League Championship. This is the second straight year the program won the title. Last year, the outfit played under their old name [Indians] under coaches Don Fodaski and Chris Barsa.&nbsp;</p>
