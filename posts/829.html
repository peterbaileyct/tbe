Charter review members Hal Kilby, Jack Krampitz and Michele Roalf and I continue our conversation about their deliberations with the Charter Review Commission. The process winds up this Thursday with the final public hearing at the City Council Chambers at 6:30 p.m.

Part 2 of the hour plus conversation begins with some thoughts about what it was like working together with members of different political parties toward a common goal.Â Kilby is a member of the Republican Party, while Krampitz and Roalf are members of the Democratic Party.

From these initial thoughts, the conversation moves onto technical language involved with the renaming of the joint board to a joint meeting and bond issues to reassignment of sanitary sewers from Public Works to the Water Dept.

Membership of the commission is determined by the mayor with requirements set by the state. Aside from these three, members include Chair Calvin Brown, Vice Chair Jon FitzGerald, and Commissioners Sandra Bogdanski, Jonathan Mace, Craig Minor and Laurie Scotti.

The commission's draft report is available here: <a href="http://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Charter-Revision-Report.pdf">Charter Revision Report</a>
