<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;Taking another look at last Thursday’s Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern softball game – a thrilling encounter between two talented and well-coached teams – seemed to be in order even after both squads have moved on from the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Rams dropped a heartbreaking 2-1 decision in eight innings, it is painfully obvious that Central is a dangerous team, capable of pinning a loss against any program in the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That outcome obviously is not what we wanted but I couldn’t be prouder of that effort and the execution defensively,” said Central coach Monica Hayes after the game. “I thought we did so many things well. Eastern put the ball in play and we made some big-time outs in the later innings there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep in mind, the Rams did not commit a single error in the field while any mental mistakes were few and far between.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After posting a 7-3 victory at Conard of West Hartford last Friday, Central is a sterling 7-3 and has its collective sights on home field in state tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Losses like the one against Eastern simply help to improve Central’s program in the end because of the experience factor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have some young kids out here,” said Hayes. “Once they get into more situations like that and they know where the ball has to go and they see the importance of doing those things that we practice and practice, now they can see it in a game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Kaley Laird, who led off against Eastern, is a sophomore while Leah Sklenka is a talented freshman in right field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Samantha Sklenka (sophomore) is a force in centerfield while the two-headed monster of Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto are a dangerous 1-2 punch in the circle – both only in their sophomore campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two pitchers throw strikes and when competing in the field, Torreso plays a mean first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Lorelei Stancavage catches behind the dish while Central turns to three talented seniors that are helping guide the program along through outstanding play and leadership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Bartell (third base) is an excellent athlete, Kayla St. Onge does a little of everything and the home run hitting Gwen Torreso is a talent at shortstop and one of the best all-around players in the CCC South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you don’t make mistakes, battle your nemesis to the end, and come away with only a 2-1 loss on the road in extra innings, what more can you do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That was just a good softball game,” said Hayes. “At some point, somebody is going to execute better than the other team and whoever’s winning at the end, that’s what happens.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reality for Central is the program carries an excellent ledger with just three losses, all coming against some of the elite squads of the CCC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams fell at Southington (9-6) back on April 23, Central was on the wrong wide of a 9-3 tilt at home to Berlin on April 28 and then the only other setback was the one-run loss to Eastern this past Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breaking apart the overall records of those teams Central fell to shows a unique trend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into Monday, Berlin is undefeated (10-0), Southington has lost once (8-1) while Eastern carries just three losses overall (7-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have dropped its games to teams with a combined ledger of 25-4 with the locals in both the Southington and Eastern showdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Young teams are supposed to lose but just about any program not named Berlin or Southington is going to lose games like that to the best teams in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Central has shown the ability to topple those superb squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s rematch against Eastern comes on May 24 and with just a little additional seasoning, the outcome between the city rivals could be much different the second time around. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Besides Berlin and Southington, we really haven’t been pressured,” said Hayes. “I thought [the Eastern game] was a great experience to learn how to play under pressure in a regular season setting because that will only help us moving forward with the lack of experience that we have.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think this is a great learning experience for all of us moving forward when we get to the tournament the next time we play.”&nbsp;</p>
