<p>“The Rotary Club held a traditional golf tournament for over 30 years. Three years ago, we decided to make some changes and play Mini Golf instead. It is something that appeals to all ages, whether you are 2, 20 or 80,”&nbsp;said Patti Philippon, chair of the Club’s Mini Golf Committee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Participants will have the opportunity to play a fun round of 18-holes of golf, take part in a Hole-in-One competition, enter a 50/50 raffle, and try their luck winning some fun drawing prizes. In addition, each player goes home with a goodie bag.</p>
