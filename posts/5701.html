<p>The CCC Softball Tournament commences over the next three days (May 27, 28 and 29) and the squad from Bristol Central is in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the Class L Tournament commences, the Rams have the chance to gain a little invaluable postseason experience and are playing with a bit of house money in this CCC tilt.</p>

<p>Win and Central continues on its torrid pace - meaning an additional game and even more play in a pressure-pack environment.</p>

<p>Lose and the Rams are still all the better for it because of the extra ‘tournament style’ game (and experience).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, winners of eight straight games, and 10 of its last 11, have been playing extremely well as of late and you know the senior core - led by Gwen Torreso, Janessa Bartell, and Kayla St. Onge - are ready for the challenge of the CCC Softball Tournament.</p>
