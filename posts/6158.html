<p>The Mountain View neighborhood, tucked away in the northeastern section of Bristol along the Farmington and Plainville town line, is relatively quiet, awash in its own rhythms.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On any given day you could find kids riding their bikes, car repairs in driveways, gardens being tended to, walkers, pick up basketball games and last Thursday afternoon, a black bear.</p>

<p>According to Facebook posts and home video footage, a black bear decided to get a closer look of the area for himself. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Standing over 5 ft., he was spotted around 4:45 p.m. on Anthony Dr. rummaging through backyards and later on Vera Rd. climbing an oak tree, while being keenly observed by a house cat. </p>

<p>In recent weeks, black bears have appeared in the neighborhood searching for food. Residents are reminded to keep their garbage cans tightly shut to keep them away from homes. </p>

<p>The State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) created a webpage with useful information on how to deal with black bears, which can be found by <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Wildlife/Nuisance-Wildlife/Living-with-Black-Bears">clicking here</a>.</p>
