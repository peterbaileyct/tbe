<p>The City of Bristol and Webster Bank are pleased to announce that D’Amato Realty LLC, a longtime real estate and property development firm headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut, has entered into a purchase agreement for 150 Main Street with Webster Bank, which currently houses the Webster Bank branch in the downtown historic district.</p>

<p>“We at D’Amato have deep roots in Bristol and are happy to have come to an agreement with Webster to purchase this historic property in the city’s downtown,” said Edward D’Amato, Sr. “We plan to put our extensive experience in transforming and reusing older buildings to adapt this former bank branch to modern uses, while maintaining its character and features.”</p>

<p>The 150 Main Street building has served as a Webster Bank branch since 1994 after Webster’s acquisition of the former Bristol Savings Bank. The building has been home to a bank continuously since its construction in 1907 as the home of the Bristol Trust Company.</p>

<p>“We are so pleased the Webster branch building will find a new life in the good hands of the D’Amato family,” said Bristol Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “The building has been the centerpiece of our historic downtown district, and we are confident the developers will find the highest and best use for the building.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building was designed by Walter Crabtree in the Neoclassical Revival style and serves as the centerpiece of the Main Street Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The building is constructed of marble with a tiled roof and large brass doors. The main banking room has a cove ceiling with four murals representing agriculture, industry, commerce and finance. The finance mural shows a figure holding a tablet flanked by New York City’s Treasury Building and the Bristol Trust Company.&nbsp;The murals were the work of artist and teacher Vesper L. George.&nbsp;</p>
