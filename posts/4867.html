<p>Today, I am adding to my Pulitzer Prize winning series on great places to walk in the Bristol area. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Granted, this is a minor sub-category in the Pulitzers, "<strong>Local  Web Columns That Have Fewer Than 30 Readers," </strong>but<strong> </strong>I believe this entry will put me over the top, bringing glory both to me and The Bristol Edition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s topic is about one more gem in the Bristol Parks system, the Hoppers/Birge Pond Dog Park. This hidden treasure is one many Bristolites may have escaped but comes highly recommended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main parking lot to the walking trails is off of Perkins Street right across from Chippens Hill Middle School. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is another parking lot down at Birge Pond, but entering from there requires a lengthy trek up a fairly steep hill, which is not recommended to anyone vaguely resembling Jabba the Hutt. I, however, prefer the lower lot, as long as I have remembered to pack my portable oxygen tank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who walk in the Hoppers do so for multiple reasons. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, dogs love it there, as they get to feel some freedom, socialize with other dogs, and don’t have to wear their masks while walking outside. (I wish the CDC would give these dogs a break. There is no evidence that they spread COVID any more than a cat does.) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, the trails in the woods are peaceful and picturesque, providing that taste of country only a 3-minute drive from Route 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third, you can choose the length and difficulty level of your walk. You can do a single loop around the field (about 3/4 mile and very easy), or choose different trails through the woods that can range from 1 and 1/2 miles to close to 3 miles or more (not so easy, since the trails through the woods are a little hilly and can be a bit of a challenge, but at no point are they impossible).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the Park Department has done an outstanding job making the entire experience a pleasant one. They have installed a paved parking lot very convenient to the walking trails. And they have even installed a free dispenser of dog “poop” bags to make cleaning up after your dog an easy task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This last point reminds me: Years ago, before the bag dispenser, people just let their dog poop and run. As a result, walking the trails was hazardous duty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never served in the armed forces, but I have some idea what walking a mine field might be like, short of the military reality that people die in mine fields. On park trails, you get the idea, every step was fraught with "danger." </p>

<p>So you would think it is a lot better today. It is, but there are still some brazen citizens who bend the rules or ignore them completely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please let me give these scofflaws a brief tutorial.</p>

<h2><strong>Poop removal tutorial</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Step 1: What you see when you get out of your car is a sign with DOG WASTE in big bold letters across the top. (See photo.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">Step 2: Ask yourself, "Am I walking my dog?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>If yes, proceed to Step 3. </li><li>If no, continue on your merry way.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">Step 3:  Ask yourself, "Do I have a poop bag in the event that the dog I am walking, my dog, might poop?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>If yes, proceed to Step 4</li><li>if no, grab a poop bag from the dispenser.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">Step 4: Walk your dog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>If, as you walk, your dog poops, proceed to Step 5.</li><li>If, as you walk, your dog does not poop, continue on your merry way.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">Step 5: Your dog poops, so ask yourself, "What do I do?" You remember the posting. You pick up the poop. (See instructions for picking up dog poop, below.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>If you have a poop bag that you brought, use the bag. (And good for you, but you are not done yet.)</li><li>If you did not have a bag when you arrive, you should have grabbed one from those provided in those handy dandy poop bag dispensers at the entrances, so now you have to mark the spot, go get a bag, and pick up the poop.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Instructions for picking up dog poop with a poop bag:</strong> Put the bag (see photo) on your hand, pick up the poop (see photo), turn the bag inside-out, tie it up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Step 6: Dispose of your poop bag in the trash can. All done!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">The entire job takes about 30 seconds. A hidden bonus is that in the winter, it warms your hand for a few seconds. And when spring arrives, as it does today, bringing the warmer weather with it, less poops means you can smell the flowers--when they bloom!</p>

<p>It is not the most pleasant job in the world, but you’re the one who decided to have a dog. So do your job!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, that’s about it for this week. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the Hoppers is a great place for a walk in a beautiful unspoiled and unsoiled spot right here in our own backyard. But you rebels who don’t do your job, I’m watching you!</p>
