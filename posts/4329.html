<p>Here’s a look at the Bristol Eastern boys basketball team for the 2021 season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Last year, Eastern lost six games by four points or less - including two contests in overtime. That’s where state tournament qualification was lost in 2019-20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with a boatload of offensive weapons returning to the fold in 2021, Eastern head coach Bunty Ray has all the confidence in the world in this group of athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ll compete every night just like we always do,” said Ray. “It’s just a matter of us making shots.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the head of the class is senior Elijah Parent (16.8 points, 2.6 assists, 3.3 three-pointers made-per-game) and he’ll be counted on to shoulder a big chuck of the offensive load.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can attack from outside-in, will finish at the hoop - and the free throw line - and once again is one of the leaders on the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern needs offense from the full complement of players at the other four positions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m hoping to make this team more balanced,” said Ray of the offense. “Obviously, Elijah is going to do what he does. He’s a great player. He put a lot of time in the offseason. He’s done a lot of things to his game but we have to be more than one player and the things we’re doing are heading in that direction.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think that we are making things equal opportunity and some other guys are going to have to produce in order for us to win some games.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two new seniors that will produce off the bat includes Josh Kolano and Alex Fernandez.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kolano has shown a willingness to rebound and hit shots from the outside while Fernandez will help run the Eastern offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both players will factor into the offensive mix and be counted on for more than a little scoring punch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are not just great additions but they’re great kids,” said Ray of Kolano and Fernandez. “The hard part is trying to get them acclimated to all the things they need to do in order to win in the Central Connecticut Conference. They are talented but we also have to get on the same page of what we do in order to get them more successful.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I wish we had more time but we don’t. We are just going to have to get them moving a bit quicker and acclimated to what we need to do to win games.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s an experienced senior trio in the form of Dylan Woodsome, Trini Otero, and Tyler Donohue.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three of those athletes missed time due to injuries last year but each gained a measure of varsity experience that should pay off during their final campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome (3.9 points, 3.4 rebounds) missed 65-percent of the season last year due to a quirky shoulder injury and was sorely missed on both sides of the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a steady hand that can and will play defense (1.6 steals-per-game in 2019-20) and is another chemistry guy for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trini Otero flipped in over nine points and 4.3 rebounds-per-game and is always a threat from downtown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He knows how to pass the ball and his offensive will be critical for the Lancers this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donohue came on during the midseason of 2019-20 and turned himself into a product reserve (2.0 points, 2.9 rebounds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior can bang in the post and hit a critical three-pointer from time to time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that trio has experience and aren’t afraid of the bright varsity lights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Donohue has a lot of heart and potential,” said Ray. “All three of them, it’s just a matter of getting them – chemistry wise – on the same page and fitting them into roles so we can be productive.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Nasir Walker will see time at guard and he played in all but three of Eastern’s games last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, he should help direct the offense and make an occasional shot, or two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Jack Stavens will be an important reserve for the Lancers, another player with rebounding prowess and ability to connect from deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Others guards that could add a little zest to the line-up include senior Trevor Nohilly and sophomore Nate Fries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nohilly will bounce around all over the court and if Fries has a chance to fire up a couple three-pointers, he will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, it’s all about chemistry but once this program finds a little rhythm, victories should follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad has already faced challenges and due to quarantine, Parent finally got back into the practice mix late last week which slowed down the overall learning process a bit with those two new seniors trying to find their spots in the mix.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the group is confident and its coach just wants to get those kids ready for 12 grueling games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our numbers are a little bit down,” said Ray. “But the young kids have been working very hard. At the same time, it’s a big jump to the varsity level. I think we’re a work in progress. I don’t think where we are in the beginning is where we’ll be in the end. I think we just need a little more gym time.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just need to get everybody in together and I think we’ll be okay.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch (online) this season</strong>: This coming Friday, on February 12, Eastern and Central square off for the first time in a showdown that never disappoints.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rematch takes place on March 11 from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of Bristol Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain comes to town on March 18, the furthest date the Lancers have ever played a regular season game on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Eastern won’t see any weak teams in CCC, Region B this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“New Britain is good, Southington is good, Farmington is good [and] so is Avon,” said Ray. “There’s a lot of good teams. They are all the same. I think Central is probably head and shoulders above the rest just because of what they present and athletically, obviously, with Clingan. You have a special player there.”&nbsp;</p>
