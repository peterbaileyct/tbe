<p>My daughter texted for me to check the lawn across the street.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Vulture eating a squirrel," the text said. "What has the town become?! The Serengeti?!!!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was joking about the Serengeti but not the vulture, which turned out to be a turkey vulture cleaning up after a hawk caught and killed the squirrel.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I grabbed my camera and headed over, totally ignoring boundaries, because I did not want to scare the bird and I had concerns about my own safety.</p>

<p>Keeping close to my neighbors house, partially protected by a bush, I was startled when my neighbor whispered from inside the house. She was watching the bird.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"You should have seen the hawk," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I apologized, took a few more photos, two of which appear here, and headed back home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next morning my wife Mary reported that on her morning walk she noticed two birds acting erratically in one of the trees above where the buzzard had its meal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn't long, she said, before she saw a hawk emerge from the tree. She suspected the hawk had found the birds' next.</p>
