<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Greeners have been an excellent addition to the 2021 Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the expansion squad is going to be in every game this year, playing an excellent brand of Bristol baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners battled against Malloves Jewelers in the first game of a doubleheader on Wednesday from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol played extremely well but allowed the Jewelers to score three times in the top of the first inning as the visitors nabbed a 3-2 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners got an outstanding performance from pitcher Travis Mays as the former Bristol Eastern standout gave it one heck of an effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He retired 14 of 15 batters at one point of the game while allowing seven hits and tallying nine strikeouts overall, falling to 0-2 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Trevor was working well,” said Bristol coach A.J. Lorenzetti.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit belongs to the Jewelers’ John Martin and while he didn’t overpower the Greeners on the hill, he threw a complete game that included just six hits and five strikeouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Zach Marquis led Bristol from the plate, going 2-for-3 with a double and a walk while Lorenzetti added a double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all the scoring in the game for both teams came during the first inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Jewelers put three runs on the board as a run scoring single from Austin Roy and an RBI groundout by Mike Munson netted two runs while a passed ball allowed a third runner to scoot home as the visitors led 3-0 before Bristol got to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think in the first inning, there were a couple balls that just found a hole and I was really proud of Mays for bearing down after that,” said Lorenzetti. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the runs across for him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the tilt, the Greeners got two of those runs back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marquis led off with a blazing double to the gap in right and with two outs, Jon Pierce dropped in a single to center as the lead runner hustled home to make it a 3-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Lorenzetti smoked a double over the head of the fielder in center as Pierce easily scored to chop the deficit to 3-2 through one completed frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mays settled down nicely in the top of the second, fanning the final two batters he faced to keep it a one-run contest, retiring six straight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the tilt, Jonah Giblin reached on an error and Marquis walked to put two on with two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that game-tying hit never came as Bristol still trailed by one going into the third inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cole Peterson slapped a one-out hit to left but didn’t get far a Mays retired nine of 10 during one stretch as Bristol came to the plate in the bottom of the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben Mazzone was plunked by a pitch to open the frame and made it to second off a grounder from Pierce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he ended up stuck in scoring position as the Jewelers were clinging to its 3-2 edge through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marquis made an incredible catch in right field for the second out of the fourth inning, robbing Jake Radziewicz of an extra-base hit, as Mays collected strikeout five and six to end things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite a single from Keegan Bartis in the bottom of the fourth, John Martin fanned the side as Bristol still trailed by a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mays was cruising along, retiring 14 of his last 15 batters, before Chris Zampino drilled a base hit up the middle with two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a quick fly-ball out by Cole Peterson ended the fifth for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol had a chance to do some damage in the bottom of the inning as Jerry LaPenta and Mazzone each reached base via error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a double play and a groundball out stopped the rally as the Jewelers refused to yield its 3-2 advantage through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the sixth, Austin Roy and Munson plastered back-to-back hits to open things, but Mays struck out Ty Baldwin – ending his stint on the mound with one out in the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kenny Knox came in to throw with one gone and generated two quick outs as the Greeners were looking to tie the event up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Fradette opened the sixth with a blooper to left and Zach Bartolome came into pinch run but the bottom of the Greeners’ order couldn’t bring him home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Jewelers attempted to add insurance in the top of the seventh as Chris Zampino dropped a deep infield hit to short to start a rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He advanced to second on a wild pitch but Knox fanned Peterson to end the seventh as Bristol had to score a run to keep the game going with the top the order due up.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marquis complied with a single to the gap in right as the Greeners were in business as the go-ahead run was at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Martin induced a strikeout and two fly-outs to end the contest as the Greeners fell, 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We definitely had a lot of opportunities” to score, said Lorenzetti. “The guys put together a lot of [good] at-bats. I really don’t think we struck out much tonight at all. We put a lot of balls in play. Unfortunately, [the Jewelers] made a few good plays [and] we hit a few balls at them. That’s what makes the difference.”</p>
