<p>Bristol Central senior Carol Sugrue has been ice skating competitively for quite some time now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skating is not the easiest sport to pick up in Bristol, but Sugrue has traveled to several competitions and performed extremely well on the ice – bringing home a trophy or two along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And recently, she added a little more hardware to her growing collection of awards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sugrue has been awarded the Gold level Graduating Seniors Award – recognizing her achievements on the ice and inside the classroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The U.S. Figure Skating Graduating Seniors Award recognizes the hard work of student athletes who have participated in figure skating throughout high school; awards are given at the Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze level based off a skater’s level of competitive achievement in high school. Selection for this award speaks to a skater’s continued commitment to succeeding in their athletic and academic endeavors,” according to a release from U.S. Figure Skating.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word ‘time management’ certainly applies to Sugrue as she must make the time to find a facility to train at (nudge, nudge, Bristol), travel to competitions while hitting the books all at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rinks aren’t exactly found down the street in town and sometimes the hours available for Sugrue to perfect her craft don’t flow with someone working at a bank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s what makes the achievement by Sugrue even more impressive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While figure skating is not a traditional school sport, it requires the same dedication, perseverance and time management as any varsity sport,” the release continued. “It is the goal of U.S. Figure Skating to help ensure these student-athletes are recognized for those skills.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the release, there are four categories of recognition based on competition and test<br>achievements in all disciplines of figure skating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on that criteria, the student-athlete is rewarded on their highest level of achievement at one of four levels: Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is an application review process and if the athlete qualifies for the award, U.S. Figure Skating sends the student-athlete an award’s certificate, congratulatory letter, and lapel pin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This year, awards are being presented to nearly 800 student-athletes,” said the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sugrue has competed everywhere she can over the years, traveling out of the state to battle against her peers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s taken first place at the 2018 Nutmeg State Games in the 101 Intermediate Ladies SP event and has been competing at that outstanding tournament for several years now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she’s competed at several New England Regional Championship events in and around Boston during her scholastic years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the CIAC had instituted a skating program, there isn’t any doubt that Sugrue could have won a state championship or two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But instead, Sugrue has been traveling everywhere, competing where she can, achieving at the highest level while putting the time into her studies at Bristol Central high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And her teachers, and principal, at Bristol Central High School wanted to make sure that Sugrue was recognized for her for outstanding achievements – both on the rink and at BCHS. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The program [also] recognizes schools for their support of their students’ passions and<br>interests that extend beyond the walls of the school building,” said the release.</p>
