<p>BRISTOL - It came down to the wire between the Bristol Eastern and Bristol Central JV teams on Friday evening as the contest was in doubt until the final horn sounded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this time around, it was the Lancers who ended up getting to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Connor Policarpio drained two huge three-pointers over the final 33 seconds of regulation as the visitors sank the Rams by a 54-52 push from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams ended up splitting the season series 1-1 and it was late heroics this time around that saw Eastern seize the victory in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the game, Eastern coach D.J. Parent said that Policarpio (nine points) played his best game of the season, hitting three 3-pointers overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a unit, the Lancers canned 11 three-pointers - getting four big trifectas over a 21-point fourth quarter scoring barrage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed 38-33 going into the final eight minutes of action but all the fun took place over the final 65 seconds of the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the game all knotted at 48-48, Eastern’s Max Stavens (eight points) took a baseline 3 in an attempt to give the Lancers the lead but the shot missed and Central had possession of the ball with 57 seconds left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five seconds later, Central’s Julius Powell (18 points) flipped in a lay-up to give the Rams a 50-48 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Policarpio struck back, hitting his first 3 of the period as Eastern was back on top again - this time at 51-50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Mason Stokes responded with a lay-up - giving the Rams a 52-51 lead with 24 seconds showing on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Eastern had a response as Policarpio hit another dagger three-pointer and with 11 seconds to play, Eastern nabbed a 54-52 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams called timeout but had to drive the length of the court in an attempt to tie or go ahead in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the inbounds, Policarpio made a huge steal but his lay-up was blocked and with 5.2 seconds remaining, Central needed another big defensive stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a steal by Stokes nearly did the trick but his 3 at the buzzer just missed as Eastern came away with a huge 54-52 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nate Fries had a brilliant fourth quarter, hitting 10 of his 12 points over the final stanza while Ben D’Amato notched a huge 11 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Dauphinais also did well, scoring seven points for the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Powell’s 18, Jayeson Van Beveren added 13 for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led 14-10 after one period while snaring a 26-23 tally at the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central outscored the Kingstreeters 15-7 over the third tilt but that 38-33 cushion failed to hold in the end.</p>
