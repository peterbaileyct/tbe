<p>It’s been a tough year for some of our cross country and track &amp; field athletes to get a little competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fall and winter scholastic campaigns were reduced in length due to the lingering pandemic and that meant some of Connecticut’s runners were looking to test themselves outside of the Nutmeg State.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s exactly what Bristol Central’s Nate DeAngelo and Frankie Porrini had to do during the fall - with excellent finishes and results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior-sophomore - an impressive 1-2 punch on the courses and tracks - continued those showings into the spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo ran at the Garden State Track Club’s (GSTC) Last Chance Invite in Edison, New Jersey on May 22.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Both boys competed as unattached runners since the meet was out of state,” said Bristol Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if the meet was held in this state, the locals would have witnessed a finish that led to a new school record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Angelo placed third in the 3200 with a personal record and a Bristol Central school record time of 9:20.36.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the 800 meters, Porrini was in the third heat of the event - making an amazing finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini placed 18th with a time of 1:59.73, his first sub 2 minute 800.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[One] of many I’m sure” said Stafford-Kirk of the finish, “especially as he is only a sophomore.”</p>
