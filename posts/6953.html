<p>Beginning this coming Tuesday at 5:30 and again Thursday at 1:30, the Manross Memorial Library’s book club Book Bites will have an in-person discussion regarding <em>Hamnet</em> by Maggie O’Farrell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hammet is a fictional account of Shakespeare’s son, Hamnet, who died in 1596 at 11. It won several awards, including the 2020 Women’s Prize for Fiction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teresa Goulden, Branch Manager of the Manross Library at 260 Central St. in Forestville who will facilitate the event, said, “The author will not be present as this is just a discussion about the book. It is an informal discussion, and anyone is welcome to join at any time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Goulden, social distancing guidelines will be followed due to Covid. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“However, if the weather is nice, we will meet outside,” she said.</p>
