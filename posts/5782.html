<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Greeners were just one hit away from knotting up its showdown against Rainbow Graphics in the second game of a doubleheader from Muzzy Field in Bristol on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that big hit never came as the Greeners fell 5-2 in Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbow moved to 1-0 on the young season while Bristol dropped to 1-3 – playing four close games to open its first ever GHTBL campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbow’s Evan Chamberlain pitched a strong four innings, allowing just one run on four hits, fanning three, and did not allow a free pass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Travis Salois threw a one-hit seventh inning for the save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Casey Horjus battled, allowing four runs on eight hits, striking out six over 4.2 innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As Casey started mixing in that curve-ball, it was really effective especially with a lot of left-handed hitters that they have,” said Bristol coach A.J. Lorenzetti of Horjus. “He definitely kept us in it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jerry LaPenta threw well in relief, throwing 2.1 innings of three-hit ball, collecting three Ks, to keep Bristol in the mix until the very end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbow went for three runs in the top of the first frame to quickly snare the advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out, Eric Anderson and Edison Galan sketched up back-to-back hits before Marcus Fry laced a triple that nearly bounced on the line deep in right field – clearing the bases – as Rainbow led it, 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the scoring, Mike Poncini dropped an RBI double down the third base line, plating Fry, as the visitors nabbed a three-run edge in just a half inning of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In that first inning, a couple balls were hit hard, a couple went down the line but overall, Horjus did well,” said Lorenzetti.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the tilt, Zach Marquis drilled the first pitch he saw into left but a 1-6-3 double play wiped out the Bristol base runners as the home team did not score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Martin opened the second for Rainbow with a base-on-balls, but Lorenzetti – behind the plate – made a great throw to second, on what could have been a passed ball, to wipe out the runner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Horjus settled down nicely from there, striking out the final two batters of the second stanza to keep it a three-run game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the second, Lorenzetti smacked a single to right field but as the ball bounced away from the fielder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tried for second base but was tagged out on the play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Fradette ended up running out an infield hit to short but never advanced to complete the second inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbow added a run in the third as Tyler Repoli tallied an infield hit, stole second, went to third on a passed ball and scored when Jack Johnson zipped an infield hit to short, plating Repoli, to make it a 4-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the inning, Marquis slapped a long fly-ball to right that was dropped as he hustled into second base with two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Jerry LaPenta grounded out to end the third as Rainbow continued to lead it by four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Horjus went 1-2-3 in the fourth and Bristol went on the attack with one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jon Pierce singled to short left field and when the third baseman mishandled a grounder by Lorenzetti, two men were on.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pierce eventually came home on a Fradette groundout to make it a 4-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone in the Rainbow fifth, Repoli generated his second hit of the game and when Max Adams added a single of his own, the visiting aggression had something brewing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Horjus was relieved by LaPenta and helped Bristol get out of the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On what looked like a passed ball to Nick Paasch, Lorenzetti faked a throw to second base, chucking to first instead to easily get Fry retuning to the bag as the Greeners got out of the jam without a run scoring. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Skaff entered the game to throw in the fifth for Rainbow and retired the Bristol side in order – maintaining his team’s three-run edge through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta picked up two Ks in the sixth to quiet Rainbow, but Bristol was running out of time to get back into the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the sixth, LaPenta started things off with a base hit to left as Bristol was back in business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Mazzone was beaned by a pitch, the tying runner was at the plate with no one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off a long fly-ball out to right, LaPenta made it to third base safely on the play and Bristol had runners on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti then hit a grounder and appeared to arrive at first base safely but was called out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the play, LaPenta scored to chop the deficit to 4-2 with the seventh inning on deck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anderson and Galan zipped up back-to-back singles with two outs in the seventh and then when Repoli’s pop-up behind third base was not fielded, Anderson scored to make it a 5-2 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s difficult when we’re only averaging a couple runs a game,” said Lorenzetti. “I know it’s early [in the season]. But if we can come out and get a few runs early in the game, and really give our pitcher a lead, it will help the defense relax a little bit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rally was on for the Greeners in the seventh as Stephen Warkoski dropped a ball into short right for a single as Kenny Knox came into pinch run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Salois fanned Johan Giblin for the first out while Zach Bartolome drew a walk and the top of the order was up for the Greeners with the tying run was at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the showdown, Marquis drew strike three and LaPenta grounded out as Salois earned the save as Rainbow came away 5-2 winners from Muzzy Field.</p>
