<p>Last week Lisa Maghini Santiago was our guest on "Ten Minutes." This week we hear from her 20-year old daughter Lauren. A music student at Central Connecticut State University, Lauren is in the middle of exams, having had one the previous day and another planned after our conversation. The exams involve cameras and computers, as well as instruments. We talked on Thursday, May 8, from her home where she is sheltering in place with her three siblings, mother and father. </p>
