<p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. -&nbsp;Former Bristol Eastern girls soccer standout Myah Croze has put together an amazing start for the women’s soccer program over at Western Connecticut State University this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the team has followed her lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WestConn is a perfect 13-0 on the season and currently is in first place in the Little East Conference with a perfect 5-0 ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Croze, a junior competitor for the program, has been nothing less than sensational this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, even more awards have come her way this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, she’s earned Women’s Soccer Offensive Player of the Week honors in the LEC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a 2-0 week for the undefeated WestConn women's soccer team,&nbsp;Croze tallied four goals and an assist to lead the squad to another couple victories. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of scoring, Croze blasted the ball into the net three times in a victory over Plymouth State University last Friday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Croze leads NCAA Division III with 20 goals on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add in her three assists, Croze has a blazing 43 points overall this year (that’s two points for a goal and one point for an assist) with seven game-winning scores on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze has scored in all but one match this season and has tallied over 1,000 minutes to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s scored at least two goals over six matches and has two games of three scores. Those collegiate hat tricks are really hard to come by.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget keeper Karly Martin - a long time teammate of Croze at both Eastern and WCSU - who is also having one heck of a season for the program in Danbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting all 13 matches, she’s allowed just seven goals and made 62 saves - carrying a 89.9-percent save average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin has gotten stronger as the season rolled on, allowing five goals over her first five matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then over a stretch of eight matches, Martin yielded just two scores over a span of three-plus weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Western is also a highly ranked squad among local programs of the New England area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On October 6, WestConn placed fifth in the latest United Soccer Coaches Division III Region One poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program remains among the teams ‘Also Receiving Votes’ in the USC national poll, released on Monday.</p>
