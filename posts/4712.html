<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to COVID-19 protocols, the Bristol Central boys basketball team will only have one game this week as Bristol Eastern won’t be playing (again) this Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams will have a little revenge on their minds as Plainville comes to town for a Region B showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has yet to be defeated this year but the Blue Devils gave the squad one of its toughest tests to date in the first showdown between the schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to look for when Central and Plainville clash in Bristol on Monday:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Plainville (1-6) at Bristol Central (8-0)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium, Bristol Central high school</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils gummed up the works against the Rams on Saturday, February 27 but Central still defeated Plainville, 64-61, from the Ivan Wood Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But from the friendly confines of the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol, the Rams are looking to post a big number against the Blue Devils in the rematch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the only thing Central center Donovan Clingan hasn’t done this season is hit a 3-pointer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will that first long range bomb finally come against Plainville?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because, frankly, what hasn’t Clingan already accomplished this season?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He continues to be a double-figure scorer/rebounder - cashing in on 24.6 points-per-game - and he’s just three points away from notching his 200th point of the shortened campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if Plainville is going to crowd the Central center, with double and triple teams, this is a game where the rest of the squad can do damage offensively by connecting from deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damion Glasper (9.1 ppg) is looking for his 10th three-pointer of the year while Sean Wininger (8.8 ppg) is just a tick behind in the scoring department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carson Rivoira (7.5 ppg) has been a pleasant surprise in the scoring department while doing so many other little things outside of putting points on the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s capable of scoring 10-plus points while Victor Rosa (4.0 ppg) continues to bring the defense to the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget the scoring capabilities of Eli Rodriguez (3.4 ppg) who plastered New Britain for 17 points earlier in the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Ante Ross and Piotr Nizleski may also slip in a 3 along the way while Tre Jones is another option that could help slow down those fast guards from Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils have different scoring options and the squad loves to bomb from deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The backcourt of Ty Johnson and Omar Miller are volume shooters that can put the ball through the net while Alec Couture, a 6-foot-2 guard/forward, can also hit 3s and will score points in bunches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brennan Staubley adds some size up front while Dylan Hall provides offensive punch but Plainville - like every other CCC Region B squad - doesn’t have an equal to Clingan and must throw its smaller roster in mass quantities against the future NCAA Division I talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget, this game has two veteran coaches at the helm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville employs long time Newington mentor Scot Wenzel while Central turns to Tim Barrette who has done a fantastic job building up the program for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could be a game against Plainville early but the ultimate outcome will not be in doubt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>City Series Contest Postponed</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, the Central/Eastern tilt was scheduled but will not be played due to COVID-19 protocol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A make-up date has not yet been announced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will be down four games and getting all those contests in certainly won’t happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has home games scheduled against Lewis Mills (March 15) and New Britain (March 18) but the fate of the other four make-ups are unclear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had road games against Avon, Southington, and Central while a home date against Plainville in Bristol are the contests Eastern will attempt to squeeze in before the CCC Tournament commences.</p>
