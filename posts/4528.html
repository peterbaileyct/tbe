<p>“We recognized the fact that Bristol manufacturers want to grow, but may require assistance in doing so.

<p>Bristol Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu stated, "Many of Bristol’s business incentive programs are reserved for manufacturers undertaking major expansions or for new construction projects. There are many great manufacturing companies in Bristol that may not be planning major building projects but, nonetheless, are employing local residents, producing wonderful products, and looking to grow. This program is an opportunity to assist businesses looking to improve operations, which will keep them<br>profitable and growing in Bristol.”</p>
