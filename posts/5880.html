<p>The American Legion senior baseball squad from Bristol is on the cusp of starting its season and expect some big things from Post 2 on the diamond this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program expects to be a state playoff contender by the time the postseason rolls around and will employ a roster that should rival most of the other teams in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there’s a ton of baseball to be played from now until then.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Is this Zone 1?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 1 is going to look a little different in 2021 with several teams coming and going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The roster of teams in Bristol’s division this year includes Avon, Berlin, Meriden, Naugatuck, Newington, Simsbury, Southington, and West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditional Zone 1 programs, such as Terryville, Unionville, Torrington, Wolcott, and Winsted, are not fielding U19 programs this summer, and its players are competing under other banners for different teams and towns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of those players will even end up in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are only five zones this season in American Legion baseball in Connecticut and some divisions, like Zone 6, have both a Northern and Southern line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s pool of players increased in 2021 with other programs folding as athletes from Terryville, Wolcott, Waterbury, and Oakville will all make up part of Post 2s historic program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upcoming Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Senior program begins play this Thursday as Bristol is in action against West Hartford from Hall High School in a Zone 1 showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is at 5:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, June 11, Post 2 has its home opener against South Windsor in a non-conference showdown at 6:30 p.m. and on Saturday, Bristol is back in action at 7 p.m., under the lights, as Wallingford comes to town for another exhibition tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To wrap up the weekend on Sunday, Post 2 gets its first crack at Berlin from Muzzy Field at 10 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in the year, Fairfield makes an appearance on July 3 while Branford will play Bristol on July 23 in other non-zone tilts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol program will once again be guided by head coach Jerry LaPenta, and he’ll have a sizable roster at his disposal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be plenty of action down at Muzzy Field this summer and it’s the perfect time to get out of the house and catch an exciting game from the historic venue.</p>
