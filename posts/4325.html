<p>For the second straight season, the Bristol Central boys basketball team is going to be denied a chance at a state championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, with an opportunity to get on the court and actually play again with friends and teammates, the team has other goals in mind with the pandemic raging in the background.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What do I expect or hope this season? To make it through twelve games,” said Central coach Tim Barrette. “I hope my kids have an opportunity to play twelve-plus games.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are stacked, is a group that has played together for more than a couple years and will be looking to mow down all the local Central Connecticut Conference foes during a slick 12-game schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And along the way, a certain 7-foot-1 center will continue to cement his legacy at Bristol Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the regular season for scholastic boys hoop ready to commence this week, let’s take a look at the team from Bristol Central:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL BOYS BASKETBALL</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Tim Barrette (14th season)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In 13 seasons at Central, Barrette carries an all-time record of 140-140.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record:</strong>&nbsp;17-5 overall (Division II, ranked No. 4). Central was looking for a state title bid but the pandemic stopped the postseason before the Rams were ever able to play a first round game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Subtractions</strong>: Austin Brown and Shane Ouellette (guards), Mike Lorenzetti (forward).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Probable Starters: </strong>Donovan Clingan (jr, center), Sean Wininger (sr, forward), D’Ante Ross (sr, forward/guard), Damion Glasper (jr, guard), Victor Rosa (jr, guard), Carson Rivoira (jr, forward).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Players</strong>: Piotr Nizielski (sr, guard), Elijah Rodriguez (sr, guard), Dominic Amara (sr, forward), Roberto Negron-Cruz (sr, guard), Tre Jones (sr, forward).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Long, athletic, <em>very </em>tall&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp;Speed. Won’t be able to compete for a state championship this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Central will be successful</strong>: The guy that’s 7-foot-1, 260 pounds and understands the game better than anyone else on the floor is the reason why the Rams could go undefeated this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>Coach Barrette never hit a three-pointer over his 48 games for the boys basketball team at Bristol Eastern but most of his squad at Central has.&nbsp;That’s the evolution of basketball 20 years later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Not So Fun Fact: </strong>There could be more college scouts at Central’s games than spectators this year. That ‘Not So Fun Fact’ will at least be fun for any player that is at least 7-feet tall for the Central program…&nbsp;</p>
