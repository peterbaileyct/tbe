<p>With collegiate sports finally in full swing, that means former Bristol Eastern softball standout Taylor Keegan is getting a chance to take the field for the program at Western New England University.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Keegan hasn’t played in every game, she’s made a positive impact over 14 of the squad’s 22 contests this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Keegan takes the field, something good always seems to happen for the Golden Bears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her first season of collegiate play, Keegan is posting a slick .308 batting average that includes a .357 on-base and .423 slugging percentage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The infielder has made 26 plate appearances of Sunday, slamming out eight hits that includes one double and a triple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan added two walks, two stolen bases and seven runs scored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s hitting just above the team batting average (.306) and has two multi-hit games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Golden Bears 6-5 victory over Salve Regina on April 7, Keegan went 2-of-5 from the plate that included two RBI and a run scored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in a showdown at Nichols College on April 21, the freshman had a tremendous game - going 3-of-4 overall - scooping up a double and triple while notching an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan also stole a base to complete another very good effort from the former Bristol Eastern star.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s a Health Sciences major at Western New England and one of the many athletes for the program who played scholastically in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her bio on <a href="http://ncsasports.org/">ncsasports.org</a>, Keegan said she had an interest in science and WNEU will help her pursue a career in that field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while she’s hitting the books and going to class, Keegan is also hitting the ball for a very successful team amid a Commonwealth Coast Conference Championship bid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of Sunday, the program from Springfield, Massachusetts has won six straight games - seizing a 16-6 ledger overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team has played 12 games from Springfield - going 11-1 from Golden Bear Softball Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan graduated from Eastern in 2020 and was a CCC South All-Conference pick in 2018 and 2019 - playing softball for head coach Scott Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had the athletic ability to play anywhere on the field including second base and centerfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Lancers, Keegan was one of the featured players in the Mum City with a knack of generating the big hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she always brought defensive intensity to every game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a junior, Keegan ramped up a huge campaign at Eastern and ended up being selected for the Jr. Select Game after a stellar regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the 2019 scholastic campaign, Keegan roped up a tremendous .425 batting average as she slugged the ball at a blistering .525 clip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 80 at-bats, Keegan zipped out 34 hits - eight of those going for extra bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan only struck out five times, scored a team-high 27 runs while collecting eight walks and nine RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She blasted out eight doubles and stole four bases while helping the Lancers to a sterling 17-6 record.</p>
