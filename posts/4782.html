<p>Come Sunday morning, I will have dissected a cow eye with a physiology-anatomy class at school and I will have checked out Bristol Bucks, a new initiative to keep Bristol dollars in Bristol. In addition, child No. 3 will have spent some time working from home, Mary and I will have listened to President Biden deliver his speech after signing his first major piece of legislation—listened over the radio; somewhat of a throwback. </p>

<p>And, of course, all clocks will have been turned one hour ahead. </p>

<p>We rarely watch TV&nbsp;news,&nbsp;we rarely watch TV. We get in a little Friday night. After a long week, and every week is long, Friday is a little get-away. And after all these years, it is still pizza night; although we rarely make our own pizza, the way we did when the kids were young and pitched in. Mostly it is Chunky Tomato, and when it is not Lent, we alternate between pizza and sandwiches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week we ordered out several times. Early on it was Bristol Pizza, then on Thursday Greer’s, and Friday, well, Chunky. When one of the kids is visiting, we seem to order out more, so that they can get a taste of the food that they miss, having moved on and away. Among other favorites are Pure Foods, Pint &amp; Plate and Monterrey.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bristolbucks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bristol Bucks</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/bristol-bucks-local-rewards-card-launching-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interesting concept</a>, and one that makes a lot of sense. Get a card with a QR code, visit a business that has signed on, purchase food or a service, scan the card with your rewards. When you build up enough credits, you qualify for a discount. Not at all complicated. The one behind the project is Mark&nbsp;Walerysiak&nbsp;Jr., co-founder of&nbsp;Giverrang, the start-up that originated the program.&nbsp;Walerysiak&nbsp;was involved with Bristol Rising and Bristol All Heart, as well other Bristol initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Biden will be going on the road to promote his American Rescue Plan, one that is increasingly popular across the party divide. It is my contention that once we get beyond the us-versus-them reports from national media, people appear to be more united than not. Focus on the “whats” that help people across the board and how to get these “whats” done, rather than focusing on personalities, might just be the way to go—and to report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which leads me to a special concern that I hope to follow and write&nbsp;about:&nbsp;there are&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;laws being considered in Connecticut to amend our voting process and make it more accessible, which, at first, made me feel pretty good. As a democracy, we really need to make voting accessible to as many people as possible. What gives me pause is that there as many if not more laws being considered to narrow accessibility. Chances are the latter will not make it into law, but it is a good reminder that the veil is thin, that the difference between progress and regress on such items of importance to our democracy is thin, and because of this we need to remain informed and engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And lastly, I took a walk down Memorial Boulevard Saturday. It wasn’t Thursday or Friday with temperatures ranging into the 60’s, but the sun was shining, and the air was clear, and the arts school project is progressing nicely. The earth around the base is being removed, making the building a story higher. Already a beautiful structure, this step, from what I can see, creates an even more dynamic structure with an even more prominent effect for our gateway to the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether I like how the project has come to pass doesn’t really matter much. We have an arts school—and a wonderful theater—in our midst and we need to make the most of it, rather than bemoaning its inception. Along with the recent development on North Main Street, a letter of intent with the city for much of Centre Square by the same Carrier concern that is building townhouses on Main St., the arts school project really does provide us with reasons to rally and aim for the best.</p>

<p>Oh, and the cow eye! I heard that the anatomy and physiology class was dissecting them and invited myself to the class. Well, really, I asked the teacher if she wouldn't mind if I sat in. As with most classes during the time of COVID, things are different. There were only two students in class. All the others were online. The student I worked with held the eye below a digital camera connected to a laptop so that the online students could follow along.</p>

<p>Eyes are of some interest to me, since I have had a bunch of issues with my own over the years. Many retina detachments and a scleral buckle procedure later I am amazed that I still have sight in my right eye. Seeing what the eye is made of only reinforced my sense of the miraculous and wonder associated with sight, with vision, with the world. </p>
