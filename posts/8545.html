<p>The Bristol Central boys soccer team started slowly this fall for various reasons, but they have been getting better each day and as the first half of the season ends, they have posted 4 consecutive victories and are roaring into the second half with incredible momentum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams began the season with a loss to Middletown by a 2-1 score. That was followed by a 5-1 victory over Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central tied Avon in game four, 3-3.  The Rams were down 3-0 at halftime, and played perhaps their best half of the season in a tremendous comeback. The BC boys were disappointed they did not win because they completely smothered Avon in the second half, and had even more chances to score, but had to settle for the tie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central followed the Avon game with another tie against Newington, 2-2, and then ran off three consecutive victories, 6-1 over Maloney, 2-0 over Platt, and 3-0 over Glastonbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win over Glastonbury, a consistent state power, was one of the best regular season victories in BC history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams wrapped up the first half of the season with a solid 4-1 victory over cross-town rival Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central played only one of their first four games with a full team. They were missing two starters in the first game at Middletown for personal/family reasons. And then the Rams had four starters/regulars out for games 3 and 4 (Avon and Newington, both ties).  The four players were quarantining for the two games, but Central still battled throughout and emerged with the two ties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The end result was a 5-1-2 record for the first half of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In those first eight contests, the Rams amassed some impressive stats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carson Rivoira leads the team in scoring with 11 goals and 3 assists. Rivoira has scored a goal in every game so far.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charlie Pittman has 5 goals and 3 assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mark Palma has 3 goals and 3 assists</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ethan Crumrine has 6 assists on the season and Frank Palma has chipped in with 5 goals</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a></a><strong>Players and Positions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry Ross is a sophomore who is improving&nbsp;in&nbsp;goal and growing in confidence every game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defense is led by Beckett Hennessey and Umar Malick. Tyler D’Agostino, Chris Oren, Mitchell Peterson, Michael Allen have all been solid. The defense has done a great job of limiting the opposing teams to very few opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have gotten strong midfield play from three center midfielders - Mark Palma, Ethan Crumrine, Dorian Wilcznnski. The trio do a nice job of controlling the middle of the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outside wingers Charlie Pittman, Frank Palma, Joe Davila, Rafael Antonio, Derek Guerrero have also been rock solid. The midfielders put constant pressure on the opposing team which then translates to offensive opportunities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira has been dominant up front. He is physically strong and does not get pushed off the ball and is a very difficult matchup for opposing defenses. He has scored 5 goals off headers on free kicks and corner kicks. Crumrine takes those free and corner kicks and the two have a good connection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Bristol Central is a senior-heavy team with very good chemistry and camaraderie. They have been playing together for years and work well together. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams go into the second half brimming with confidence. They will be a difficult matchup for any team they play and have the potential to make a strong run in the state tournament.</p>
