<p>In the first 2020 installment of a great rivalry, the Bristol Eastern and Bristol Central girls soccer teams settled for a 1-1 draw after 80 minutes of play. Due to the coronavirus limitations, overtime will not be played this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>Bristol Eastern started off hot, with a great chance to score just three minutes in as Emily Nelson intercepted a BC defender's pass, beat the keeper, but was denied as her shot rang off the post. The Lady Lancers continued to dominate throughout the first half creating quality chances often.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The play shifted in the second half very quickly. In just the first minute of the second half, a Rams attacker was fouled in the box, resulting in a penalty kick, which was converted by Rachel Wygant, vaulting BC to a 1-0 lead. </p>

<p>The next 25+ minutes were played with the Rams controlling most of the play and both teams creating mediocre chances periodically.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The action really picked up with fifteen minutes left. The Rams had multiple corner kick opportunities of high quality, with one even&nbsp;bouncing off the crossbar. Central's Bella Bosco created several chances for herself, but goalie Grace D'AMato (10 saves) was up to the challenge, bailing out the Lancers multiple times, including a huge save with 14 minutes left where she pushed a great shot over the crossbar to keep the narrow lead at one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The equalizer came with 12 minutes left as the Lancers were awarded a free kick 23 yards away from goal on the left side. Ciara Collins left nothing to chance as she blasted a shot,  bouncing it off the far post and in. The final 12 minutes, although frantic, were played without another goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both teams deserved to win. Neither team deserved to lose.  A tie was the proper result.</p>
