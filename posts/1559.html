<p>In the fall of 1918, newspapers focused their reporting on the Great War. But as the troops engaged the Kaiser, a pandemic raged across the United States taking from the Mum City 113 brothers, sisters, friends, husbands, wives, mothers and fathers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Connecticut State Department of Health, published a bulletin in April 1919 (Vol. 33 No. 4) stating those most afflicted were between the ages of 20-49. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among those lost to the pandemic in Bristol include a newlywed, school- aged children, sisters, laborer’s, husbands and a mother of six. Using the limited resources currently at our disposal, here are some of the stories.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything however, was not bleak.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emerging from the sorrow and darkness are stories of heroism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lucy Adams, a visiting nurse, cared for the sick in the homes of Bristol residents and the emergency hospital. With the amount of cases dwindling, she would leave a grateful city in early November for war duties in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spanish Flu declared war on an opponent that had no means of defending itself. There were no vaccines or antibiotics; only isolation, quarantine, hydration, good personal hygiene and unproven remedies such as Bromo Quinine; a laxative which was inaccurately believed to flush the disease from the body. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scores of Bristol residents were cut down in their prime and robbed of their future. Mothers and fathers were unable to see their children prosper nor play among the cobblestone buildings at Rockwell Park or enjoy the amenities at Lake Compounce or acquit themselves in the athletic pursuits of the day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Others missed seeing Babe Ruth at Muzzy Field, the creation of Memorial Boulevard and the commercial and residential development boom in Bristol that would follow in the coming years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A report issued in June 1920 by the State Department of Health stated the influenza epidemic in Connecticut ran from September 1918 until May 1919, resulting in 115,567 cases and 8,907 deaths. Forty-eight physicians were supplied to Connecticut by the U.S. Health Service with three assigned to Bristol. Bristol also received four nurses from the State Department of Health. </p>

<p>Statistical reports tabulate numeric findings and produce tables and fractional distributions. However, they do not and cannot data capture or quantify the anguish, the grief and the value of the lives lost, nor the suffering of the grieving. </p>
