<p>Did you know Santa was scuba-certified? This holiday season, Bristol families and community members continued the tradition of visiting Santa, only this year, Santa looked a little different. </p>

<p>While COVID restrictions and precautions have forced the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth &amp; Community Services (BPRYCS) department to suspend its annual "Santa Land Village", the aquatics division embraced new COVID-friendly traditions, including having people’s underwater pictures taken with Scuba Santa.</p>

<p>As part of the Scuba Santa event on December 5th and 6th, registrants slapped on their goggles and smiles, and had their photos taken with the jolly holiday figure underwater at the Dennis Malone Aquatic Center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event also benefited a good cause. Registration was free with the donation of an unwrapped toy to benefit the Youth &amp; Community Services division’s Holiday Gift Giving Program, benefitting those in need within the Bristol community.</p>

<p>Volunteer divers from the Region 5 Dive Team donned a traditional Santa suit, embellished with scuba gear and fins!</p>

<p> “We are extremely grateful for the support from the Region 5 Dive Team who generously volunteered their time to make this event possible,” remarked Jaimie Clout, Aquatics Supervisor. Clout went on to say "The Scuba Santa event was an opportunity to get creative in offering a fun and safe holiday-themed event. Those that came out for the underwater photos with Santa had a wonderful time!”</p>
