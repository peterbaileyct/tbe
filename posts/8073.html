<p>HEBRON - With just seconds left on the clock and RHAM’s football team trailing Bristol Eastern by a 13-7 push on Friday afternoon, a one-yard goal line touchdown plunge by Max Nylen seemingly tied the game up with no time left on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with an extra point attempt looming, the Raptors had a chance to steal away game from the Lancers and win it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was just one problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time RHAM lined up to go for its game-winning TD on the one yard line, the clock - that was stopped with just seconds remaining on a questionable reception - should have run out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after Nylen (15 rushes, 123 yards) fell into the end zone, making it a 13-13 game, Eastern coach Anthony Julius ran onto the field, stating that time should have expired before the final play took place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Julius was correct, the officials came together, eventually overruling the scoring play - negating the touchdown - as the Lancers ended up on the right side of a 13-7 victory from Hebron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The official game clock was mismanaged throughout the showdown and that allowed the Raptors - and both teams early on - extra chances with the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To set up the final two plays of the game, RHAM quarterback Ryan McLaughlin (16-for-37, 199 yards) chucked the ball to Dylan Keefe - falling from inside to outside the goal on the left side - just short of the end zone on Eastern’s one yard line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball looked to have bounced on grass but Keefe’s catch stood as the official was behind the play and never actually saw the reception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM then set-up is goal-line attack and Nylen just crossed into the end zone at the buzzer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Julius protested immediately after the touchdown and for about ninety seconds or so, the scoreboard showed a 13-13 stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But instead of letting the touchdown stand, including the ensuing extra point, the officials said that the time should have been up, the score was not allowed and Eastern’s players and fans celebrated the 13-7 victory as the Lancers moved to 2-0 on the young season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was third down,” said Julius, setting up the final play. “[McLaughlin] made a nice throw to the outside, the referee ruled complete pass [to Keefe] in bounds with four seconds left. [And] it’s impossible to clock the ball. It’s impossible. I’m fortunate that the referees got together and made the right decision.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I know RHAM doesn’t feel that way. If I was on their side, I’d feel the exact same way.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern could have been trailing by double-figures at the half but instead, the locals enjoyed a 7-0 edge at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM squandered three chances in the red zone during first half play and then did so one final time to end the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Connor Gimpl sacked McLaughlin while making two tackles-for-losses, Austin Shorette had 2.5 tackles-for-losses and Nathan Shorette had the game’s only interception as the defense made critical stops when RHAM’s offense was churning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The defense really rose to the occasion,” said Julius. “We didn’t get our ground game going the way we wanted to. We had some guys get banged up throughout the game. We had to have some guys step up in some different spots and I’m incredibly proud of effort our defensive guys gave.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We made a lot of big plays when we had to. We really kind of bent and didn’t break most of the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conor McCormick had a tremendous outing, snaring three balls for 75 yards including a huge 18 yard touchdown reception while pumping out a couple critical punts along the way though he was injured late in the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Conor McCormick is a great player for us,” said Julius. “Unfortunately, he got knocked up there in the second half. We weren’t able to use him. They took advantage of some of the opprotunites we thought we had. But he’s a tough kid and hopefully, [the injury is] a minor thing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quarterback Kamden Laprise (6-for-7, 85 yards) made his final six passes while senior Alex Marshall had 25 carries for 94 yards and a touchdown as Eastern’s offense picked its spots over the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our freshman quarterback stepped up, made some really big throws and hit [receivers] on some really nice plays,” said Julius. “I couldn’t be happier with their effort.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had a couple three-and-outs to start the game but RHAM missed a critical 36 yard field goal midway the first frame to keep things scoreless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A holding penalty knocked out a 25-yard touchdown rush by RHAM in the second stanza and on the ensuing drive, Eastern finally got to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a 10 play, 83 yard drive, Marshall ended things with a three yard TD rush to make it a 7-0 game with 5:23 to go in the second period.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Raptors maintained possession of the ball for the remainder of the half but thanks to the Eastern defense, the drive ended on BE’s seven yard line via turnover at the half and another red zone encroachment was turned away by the visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored off the opening drive of the third tilt as McCormick was able to scoop in a beautiful 18 yard TD completion from Laprise for six points and with 8:21 to play, it was a 13-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That score held midway into the fourth frae before the Raptors offense finally showed some signs of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 17 yard touchdown catch by Jimmy Holland was wiped out by an illegal procedure penalty but McLaughlin went to him again two plays later - connecting with Holland for a 27 yard TD strike and with 6:46 remaining in regulation, Eastern’s lead was trimmed to 13-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[McLaughlin] is a heck of a player,” said Julius. “[RHAM’s] got really good receivers. We knew that going into [the game]. That compliments their really good ground game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams traded turnovers and with 3:19 to go, off an Eastern fumble recovered by Colton Bass, the Raptors went for the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two minutes to play, RHAM was at Eastern’s 17 - in the red zone for one final drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time was running out when rushes by Nylen got the Raptors to the six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an incomplete pass, Keefe made his late catch as time should have been up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomfoolery then ensued but when the officials ruled the final scoring play null and void, Eastern moved to 2-0 for the first time since 2013 via the six-point win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Their kids played incredibly hard,” said. Julius of RHAM. “They’re a really good football team. We are fortunate to get out of here with a win today.”</p>
