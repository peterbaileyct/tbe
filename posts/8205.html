<p>After an undefeated senior campaign for the Bristol Eastern volleyball program in 2020, sensational setter Leah Chipman wanted to play collegiately.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she knew she had the ability to excel on the next level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She performed extremely well for both the Lancers and Bristol Crush Volleyball program over the years and when Montclair State University head coach Eddie Stawinski discovered what Chipman was all about, he wanted the setter to play for his squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman had other schools intrigued, like Springfield College, but in the end, she decided to take her talents and play for the program in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montclair State University is an institution in Montclair, New Jersey with a portion of the NCAA Division III campus nestled in Little Falls.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the Red Hawks’ sports programs compete in the New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) and women’s volleyball is one of six sports offered by the institution in the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman and her squad play at the Panzer Athletic Center on campus.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over a busy freshman campaign, Chipman has already earned some floor time for the Red Hawks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through September 23, the 5-foot-6 standout played in 28 sets as the squad went 4-6 in matches that she has taken a part of.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman posted 33 assists and 22 digs in those 28 sets while dropping in one kill along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a 3-0 loss at Dickinson on September 13, Chipman collected a season-high 12 assists while bumping up six digs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On September 9 against Drew, Chipman collected nine assists and two digs while in a tough challenge against Manhattanville on September 16, the setter zipped up six assists and five digs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the setter position at Montclair has more than a couple players, Chipman is enjoying her time with the program and making the most of her opportunities on the floor when they come.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Elementary Education major was a tremendous component for the volleyball team at Bristol Eastern over her four campaigns, earning First Team All-State and All-Conference selections by the completion of her scholastic career.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman was one of the CIAC’s leaders in assists last year in her final campaign for the Lancers, tallying 401 assists over the pandemic shortened season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She averaged over nine assists-per-set and scooped up some big numbers as a senior.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman had a 48-assist game versus Avon while dishing off 45 against Bristol Central in a five-set gem from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium back on October 29.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern won that match 3-2 despite trailing early against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman was one of three Eastern players named to the All-State team last season along with Zoe Lowe and Ryley Plourde.&nbsp;</p>
