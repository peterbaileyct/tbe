<p>A celestial event appeared in the night sky&nbsp;tonight, on&nbsp;Monday, Dec. 21, which many have thought to be the “Star of Bethlehem”&nbsp;–&nbsp;a direct correlation to the Christian religion story of the birth of Jesus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/was-christmas-star-really-jupiter-saturn.html">LiveScience,</a>&nbsp;Jupiter and Saturn&nbsp;will appear&nbsp;0.1º apart, in a phenomenon known as the Great Conjunction, which appears roughly every 20 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The year 7 B.C.&nbsp;is when Christians believe that Jesus was born.&nbsp;The&nbsp;combined light in the sky&nbsp;may have been&nbsp;recorded as a star, thus&nbsp;its connection&nbsp;with the birth of Jesus,&nbsp;also&nbsp;named the Christmas Star, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://earthsky.org/human-world/was-the-christmas-star-real">EarthSky</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last recorded Great Conjunction to appear as close and as visible as this week’s occurred on March 4, 1226, according to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jupiter-and-saturns-great-conjunction-is-the-best-in-800-years-heres-how-to-see-it/">Scientific America.</a> “For perspective, Genghis Khan was still roaming Asia then,” says astronomer Patrick Hartigan at Rice University in Houston. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps the Christmas star is a sign of the times&nbsp;during&nbsp;2020. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an epic year that began with the devastating bush fires in Australia, that wiped out nearly half a billion&nbsp;wildlife&nbsp;–&nbsp;with over 12 million acres of natural habitat destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were earthquakes in Puerto Rico, floods in Louisiana, volcanic eruptions in Japan, and hurricanes along the eastern seaboard from Florida to Maine.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t until locusts&nbsp;appeared in Africa, and a global pandemic&nbsp;erupted,&nbsp;that it made me think of the seven plagues of Egypt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For believers, these events of epic proportions are a sign that we may be heading to end times, although no one really knows for sure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For non-believers, it’s simply science and the cyclical nature of the earth’s weather patterns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Either way, I&nbsp;have been&nbsp;asked, “How do you know God exists?”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My reply usually is, “How do you know he doesn’t?”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now,&nbsp;I’m not trying to convince people about the existence of God, but I am trying to convince people that&nbsp;anything is&nbsp;possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are the alternatives?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If one stops to think about life, maybe, just maybe, there&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a celestial being watching over us&nbsp;–&nbsp;now that brings comfort to many.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Life right now is difficult for all of us,&nbsp;as many people struggle to make sense of a year,&nbsp;that has yielded so many challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“</em><em>It is during the dark times</em><em>,</em><em>&nbsp;that humanity finds a way to fight for our existence</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em>&nbsp;</em>–&nbsp;Anna Bedell&nbsp;©&nbsp;2020.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I&nbsp;drove&nbsp;through Bristol over the summer, I was amazed at how empty the streets had&nbsp;become as many businesses&nbsp;closed their doors&nbsp;during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The medical staff of Bristol&nbsp;Hospital have&nbsp;worked&nbsp;tirelessly, trying to keep up with patients who were infected with COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Families lost loved ones and in the grand scheme of things, when we stop to think about what’s important in life, these following things are true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not how much wealth people collect, it’s not a person’s status, it is however, how much we value our families and friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the last day of your life will you think, “I wish I had more stuff?” No, you will probably ponder,” I wish I spent more time with the people I love.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s during our difficult times in life, when we realize who has stuck by us through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right now, I’m reflecting, I’m thinking&nbsp;that it’s four days before Christmas, yet it seems so far away.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I looked up at the night sky,&nbsp;with the hope of having even a small glimpse of the Christmas Star.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the cloud cover made it impossible to&nbsp;see any stars, let alone the moon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I prefer the name&nbsp;–&nbsp;Star of Bethlehem. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the year we’ve&nbsp;had, it is a sign of hope. It’s the perfect ending to a year of&nbsp;catastrophes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps it’s not just a Great Conjunction, but a great ending that&nbsp;leads to a new beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope that&nbsp;2021&nbsp;will&nbsp;be the year we all finally put our differences&nbsp;aside and&nbsp;come together as a community.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2020 was a cautionary tale&nbsp;–&nbsp;that&nbsp;not even Shakespeare&nbsp;himself&nbsp;could have written, let alone predicted.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Christmas miracle is the Star of Bethlehem.&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe,&nbsp;do you?</p>
