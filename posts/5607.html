<p>BRISTOL – Three days before its annual city series showdown against Bristol Eastern, the Bristol Central boys track &amp; field team took on a very good squad from Plainville on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the locals won again, collecting a 91-58 victory from the Bristol Central track in a CCC South engagement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils ended up winning events up and down the line up but the Rams got several big first place finishes from all the usual suspects to keep the Blue Devils at bay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x100 relay, Central’s sprinting squad of Cassias Breland, Trey Jones, and Xavier Browne won in 45.45 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the 4x400 relay, it was more of the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Frankie Porrini, Austin Freve, Browne, and Noah Conrod nabbed first place in 3:43 as Central took two of the three relay challenges that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Victor Rosa was busy once again and in the 100 meters, he beat all the competition with a time of 10.8 seconds and then in the 1600 meters, Nate DeAngelo and Porrini dominated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo finished 1-2 in the mile run with DeAngelo winning in 4:25 and Porrini followed just seconds behind (4:26.9).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo also grabbed the win in the 400 meters (53.7 seconds), Browne snared the victory in the 200 meters (23.4 seconds), and Porrini was the winner of the 800 meters (2:05).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the field events, Central’s Treshawn Blair was a triple-winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair took all three jumping events as he won in the long jump (19 feet, 5.25 inches), snared first place in the triple jump (39 feet, nine inches) and with his leap of five feet, eight inches, he was the winner of the high jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And also in the field, Central’s Casey Quirion won the pole vault (seven feet), Dan Lauretti took the discus event (127 feet, five inches), and in the javelin, Jakob Salinas made a toss of 136 feet, four inches to seize the first place nod.</p>
