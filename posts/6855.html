<p>SIMSBURY - The Bristol American Legion baseball program is ready for a little baseball in August.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s postseason time for the program and off a stellar 15-5 Zone 1 ledger (17-6 overall), Post 2 is one of the top seeds in the 19U Northern Division Tournament fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Zone 1 champs are ready for battle and are wary of the one-and-done situation in single elimination play this year during the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s going to be a tough game on Tuesday, no matter who we play,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “Even if a team doesn’t have a good record, all you need is one good pitcher.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not business as usual for all the teams in Connecticut as the winner won’t advance to the Northeast Regional Tournament and the usual double-elimination format wasn’t sustainable due to COVID and the late start of the American Legion regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thirty-one teams qualified for the tournament and Bristol is the third ranked squad in the Northern mix - earning two possible home games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the first round opponent isn’t any stranger to Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol drew No. 14 South Windsor (8-13 Zone 3, .381 winning percentage) who at one point was 4-13 in Zone 3 play before winning four straight games to close out the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After falling to Tri-County by a 4-3 final on July 20, South Windsor went on quite a roll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor picked off RCP (3-0), Glastonbury (5-2), EHM (6-4) and Ellington (5-2) coming into the showdown against Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an exhibition game on June 11, Post 2 defeated South Windsor 7-1 from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robbie Godi, Andrew Gough, and Greg Bidwell all got a chance to throw against Post 2 and are familiar with Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through three innings of that non-zone challenge, it was a 1-1 game before Bristol scored three times in the fourth and fifth frames to seize the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Beaucar won the game for the locals - his first of five wins this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, LaPenta expects a closer game the second time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In all playoff games, it’s going to be a 2-1 game,” said LaPenta. “It’s not going to be a big blowout or anything like that. I’ll play for runs early and try to get a lead. We’re at home so that’s a good thing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if Bristol passes its first round test, Wednesday could see another familiar squad show up at Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Advancement to the second round would have Post 2 square off against the winner of No. 4 Middletown (15-6-1) and No. 13 Naugatuck (9-10).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugy dropped the season series against Bristol (2-1) but did draw a 4-2 victory over Post 2 from Muzzy on June 19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That loss helped to keep Bristol out of the Regional Qualifier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that’s water under the bridge as Post 2 will simply take one game at a time and play the ‘survive and advance’ card when necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ll just see how it shakes out as far as who we play,” said LaPenta. “I don’t like that it’s one-and-done but, you know, we’re going to have to just [do it].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has pitching depth and all those warriors are ready for battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar (5-1 record, one save, 32.1 innings pitched) has been excellent this season while Andrew Lozier (4-0, 29 IP) is a bulldog on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Lorenzetti (1-1, 24.2 IP) has not allowed a hit over his last two starts and Roberto Cruz has five wins to his name in 2021 - coming through over numerous clutch situations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a squad ready for a deep postseason run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got enough arms to play every day,” said LaPenta. “We’ll just see if we can stay hot. Hopefully, we have a nice run in the second part of the season.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top seeds in state tournament play this year include Waterford in the North (20-2) and Madison in the South (16-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NLC headed to the Northeast Regional</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCL (Windsor Locks/Windsor), the seventh ranked squad in the Regional Qualifier, earned the bid to represent CT American Legion Baseball at the Northeast Regional Tournament in Worcester, Massachusetts from Fitton Field - starting on August 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 7 NCL defeated No. 4 Fairfield 3-0 on July 31 to advance to the Northeast Regional tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCL went 5-1 in postseason action and had to play out of the single elimination bracket - winning it all in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is slated to play Portsmith, New Hampshire in the second game of the day.</p>
