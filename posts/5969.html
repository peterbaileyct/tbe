<p>BRISTOL – After a tough 4-3 loss to West Hartford to open the campaign for the Bristol American Legion baseball squad, the team rebounded over its first two exhibition games. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of that success was due to the fact that Post 2 (2-1) had its full complement of senior players available against South Windsor this past Friday and Wallingford on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several players from Bristol Eastern weren’t available for the Zone 1 opener against West Hartford on June 10 due to the school honoring its fall scholastic sports teams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over those other two games, Andrew Lozier, Tyler Martin, Trevor Nohilly (thank goodness that Burger King crown doesn’t get brought to Muzzy Field any more…), Tyler Stickels and Dylan Woodsome were all available – making a huge difference in the final outcomes of those games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol allowed just one run over those two showdowns as Post 2 toppled South Windsor by a 7-1 final and then the Mum City favorites shutout Wallingford, 1-0, from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those were important wins by Bristol and the outfit hopes to build upon those triumphs this week with three Zone 1 games against Avon Tuesday, Meriden Thursday – with both of those showdowns coming on the road - and at home against newcomer Naugatuck in Bristol on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Big expectations</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As usual, the players on the Post 2 are looking to have another winning season, capture the Zone 1 title and snare some huge victories along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[I’m expecting] a lot of fun,” said Lozier of the Bristol team this year. “These guys are a lot of fun. It’s a good mix of guys from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern. We’ve got a Terryville kid…we’ve got kids from all over the place.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The official rosters for Connecticut American Legion baseball are in and Post 2 ended up with players from both public schools in Bristol, Terryville, and the collegiate ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of the 18 players, Lozier leads a group of eight players from Bristol Eastern, four called Bristol Central home this year, Albert Molina graduated from Terryville high school, and five players attended college – spending their summer months using their individual skills in helping Bristol have a successful campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a fun group of guys, there’s a lot of talent, and if we gel well, I think we’ll play some pretty good baseball,” said Lozier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>More exhibitions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nearly fifteen years ago, it wasn’t uncommon for Post 2 to schedule twenty or more exhibition games every summer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the typical set-up from Muzzy Field was a Zone 1 game to open the evening with a non-zone game, or exhibition contest, to follow around or just after 8 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2005, Bristol had twenty-plus exhibition games on the docket.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, because of pitch count rules and some squads carrying smaller rosters than in the past, teams are unwilling to suit up and travel to Bristol to play under the warm glow of the Muzzy Field lights.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, there aren’t many teams that want to engage in exhibition games at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That, quite frankly, is a darn shame. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’d wish we’d play some more exhibitions,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “Teams don’t want to play anymore because of the pitch count. They complain and I always say, ‘hey, throw anybody. It doesn’t matter.’ I’m only going to pitch a couple guys that won’t throw in zone games.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gone are the days when Bridgeport, Danbury, Plainville, New Milford and even the squad from Cumberland, Rhode Island would venture down Route 72 for an exciting night of baseball in the Mum City.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of those teams no longer exist but there’s always room on Post 2’s slate for another exhibition showdown or two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But some teams still want to play the Bristol squad as South Windsor and Wallingford have already played exhibitions games in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in the summer, Fairfield, Tri-County, Branford, and a trip to South Windsor are on the Post 2 schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol hopes those programs keep the non-conference games as LaPenta wants to get all his boys playing this summer – just in time for the state tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think it’s better to play in more games than not,” said LaPenta. “With the pitch count, it’s hard to get towns to play, which is crazy. Why wouldn’t you want to come here and play at Muzzy? I would think they’d want to do the same thing to get a few guys in, make them happy so the parents won’t get upset.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But I’m happy we got six exhibition games.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
