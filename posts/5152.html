<p>The Bristol Central Winter sports teams all had very good seasons between boys and girls basketball and boys swimming programs this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And due to those outstanding teams, the Central Connecticut Conference rewarded Central with two different sportsmanship awards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams won the Region B title and the overall CCC Winter Sportsmanship Award as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC was divided into four different regions this year due to the pandemic and Central ended up one of the four regional winners for local Region B.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard, RHAM, and Platt were the other schools that won sportsmanship awards for their respective regions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the CCC picked Central as the CCC’s overall award winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is how the four regions were broken down in term of sportsmanship award winners for the 2020-21 winter campaign:</p>
