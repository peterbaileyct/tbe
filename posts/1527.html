<p>The morning of Sunday September 1, 1918, started like many did in the City of Bristol.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Employees at Lake Compounce readied the park
for a performance of the Governor’s Foot Guard Band, and a fireworks display
for later that evening.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parishioners in houses of prayer from the
South Side to Federal Hill to Forestville sat elbow to elbow for Sunday
services. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Readers of area newspapers searched the
morning editions for the latest news regarding World War I.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, a mere sixty miles away unbeknownst to
anyone, a lethal virus was entering a port in New London that would have
devastating consequences in just thirty days.&nbsp;
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 saw an
estimated six hundred seventy-five thousand (675,000) Americans perish
including nine thousand in Connecticut.&nbsp;
For Bristol the final count was one hundred thirteen souls. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a report by the<a href="http://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Department-of-Health-period-ending-June-30-1920.pdf"> Connecticut Department of Health</a> issued in June 1920, the influenza first appeared in New London near the naval hospital on the first of September.&nbsp; The illness spread south and west.&nbsp; Cities like Bridgeport, New Haven, New London, New Britain and Waterbury were soon ravaged due to overcrowded neighborhoods.&nbsp; While Bristol’s estimated population of nineteen thousand seven hundred seventy-one (19,771) avoided devastation, they were not immune from the suffering, loss and misery. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What started slowly in September accelerated
rapidly with October being the deadliest month of the outbreak.&nbsp; By October 5there were at least
fifty serious cases of the flu in Bristol.&nbsp;
Schools closed in the Mum City and remained closed for a month.&nbsp; Churches and theatres followed suit and
shuttered.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within a week there were over one thousand
Bristol residents, including six physicians, stricken with the Spanish Flu
resulting in the sick not being treated.&nbsp;
The shortage of physicians resulted in many of the unattended
dying.&nbsp; Consequently, Mayor Joseph F.
Dutton appealed to the health board for a physician to assist with the
infected.&nbsp; Dr. B.A. Dawley of Toledo,
Ohio, soon arrived in Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the same time, R.F. Rousch of the
United States Department of Health was sent to Bristol, and Dr. Frank Hamblin, who
recovered from a recent illness returned to lend aid.&nbsp; Four nurses, Florence Brainard, Jennifer
Gamm, Marion Harden and Jeannette Durant were added to the staff courtesy of
the Bristol Welfare Association.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Bristol did not have a city hospital
until 1920, patients went to hospitals in other communities, which were now
filled to capacity.&nbsp; As a result, the
Parish House of the Congregational
Church was drafted to be a temporary hospital for almost four
weeks.&nbsp; During the outbreak sixty-six
patients would be treated in the makeshift hospital but there were several
deaths, including one man that died two hours after admission. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An Emergency Hospital on North Main Street was
erected too and became Dr. Dawley’s headquarters. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crest of the epidemic was the week of
October 19 with thirty deaths reported.&nbsp; By
the time October ended eight-eight Bristol citizens died due to the virus.&nbsp; However, November saw the death toll in
Bristol declined to sixteen.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
the emergency hospital had only twenty-four patients remaining, among them
sixteen children.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol schools reopened after a month with an
attendance rate of sixty seven percent.&nbsp;
One hundred seventy-nine students were excluded for illness, but the
number was reduced to three by the end of the week. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the havoc, distress and anxiety life soon
resumed with Bristol residents returning to their routines.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday November 3rd, the Bristol High
School football team defeated New Haven High at Muzzy Field 7-6. &nbsp;The local eleven hit paydirt with a scamper
across the goal line in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tuesday November 5th, voters went to one of
the four polling stations in the city to elect the next governor of
Connecticut.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come the 11<sup>th</sup>, a quickly organized parade was held
celebrating the armistice agreement ending World War I.&nbsp; There was the New Departure Band, speeches by
local dignitaries and a celebratory bonfire on the Federal Green.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, in November, movies
returned to the Bristol Theatre among them Blue Blazes' Rawden, a 1918 American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film">silent</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_film">film</a> directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Hart">William
S. Hart</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And come December, city merchants prepared for
Christmas with window displays and a hearty supply of goods.&nbsp; Gifts could be purchased at stores like J.R.
Mitchell &amp; Son, Lipson’s Fashions Store, the Bristol Hardware Company on
North Main Street and Quality Bassett, where phonographs, records and standard
goods were available. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol postmaster William A. Hayes would
report that it was the busiest Christmas on record for the Bristol Post
Office.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The preceding months had been grim and filled
with trauma and isolation.&nbsp; The
newspapers detailed casualties from the war front, and family, friends and
neighbors suffered or died from an invisible menace.&nbsp; Lacking the numerous distractions that we
possess today to cope with the anguish, it was necessary to return to normal as
soon as possible.&nbsp; Plus, it is human
nature. </p>
