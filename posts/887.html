I stopped into City Hall yesterday to pick up a couple of absentee ballots, and I learned that it's not a simple transaction.

First, absentee ballots are handled in the Town Clerk's office. I assumed wrongly that they would be in the Registrar's office.

Second, there is a process. The person requesting an absentee ballot needs to complete an application. Once the application is completed and returned to the Town and City Clerk's office, a ballot is sent in the mail to the person requesting the ballot, which means you need to plan ahead.
