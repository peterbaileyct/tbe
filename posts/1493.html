<p>No, I don't have any pictures. But they have been here, right in my backyard--a couple of deer and a large brown and white winged hawk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The apple tree in the backyard has been badly neglected these past couple of years. Despite the neglect, it keeps producing rather small and bitter apples--ones that pile up all around its base and that I have to rake and shovel into the green yard waste bucket on Sundays for Monday morning pick up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes I wait until Monday morning to take on the task, the way I did earlier this week. So I am raking up the apples, intent on my work because now I am pressured, and I notice something strange in the grass. Upon further inspection, I find two piles of animal scat, or poop. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am by no means an outdoorsman, but I know they are too big to have been produced by a skunk--yes, one travels regularly under the bedroom window--, an opossum, or a raccoon--each have been sighted in the area at different times. There is no way a squirrel or chipmunk might have produced this jumble of poop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hawk, which appeared in the neighbor's backyard the day before, kind of enters my mind. Even it was pretty large, there is no way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am stymied by these piles of poop. And, on further exploration, I under a third pile over by the red maple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, I took a few pictures of the scat--I love that I know what that word means, and I don't even know how it became part of my vocabulary. Anyhow, I showed the pictures to some friends, who, without batting an eye, determine it is deer poop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conclusion: while I have neglected the apple tree, apparently, the deer in the area have not. </p>

<p>I did say deer. I live on Federal Hill, on a busy street lined with lots of houses, both single and multi-family, near a school and a church. There is not much forest around me. Where are these deer coming from?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what about that hawk?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The day before I found the deer poop, my daughter pulled up in the  driveway. I heard the car, so I went outside on the second floor back porch to greet her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In  neighborâ€™s back yard, I saw something I could not place, immediately. At first, I thought it might be a cat, sitting on its hunches, grooming itself. The brain does play tricks on us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When my brain finally snapped to attention, it told me what I was looking at was the enormous hawk, and it was staring right at me. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I managed to get my daughter's attention. She turned to see this big bird unfurl its wings to their full glory and launch itself into the air and then out of sight in the leafy canopy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> When I told Mary about it, she said that two years or so ago, her mom watched what I am thinking is the same hawk swoop down on a robins nest in the rose bush on the north side of our home and swipe the eggs from the nest.</p>

<p>Chipmunks, squirrels, robins, pint-sized pooches beware. </p>
