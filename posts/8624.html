<p>EAST HARTFORD - This past Saturday, the University of Connecticut football squad held a 21-0 edge over Yale and with 11:15 left in the third period, the Huskies were in complete control of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Bulldogs staged a late furious rally, chopped the deficit to six and was actually one Hail Mary pass away from stealing the game against UCONN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, the ball was picked off as UCONN survived, knocking off Yale in a 21-15 final from Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first showdown between the squads in twenty-two years and was Homecoming weekend for the Huskies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nearly 18,600 fans attended the competitive bout and there was a significant Bristol presence at the game as several football fans traveled from the Mum City to see former Bristol Central standout Dathan Hickey take the field for the Bulldogs.</p>

<p>He had a solid game for Yale as the visitors were just a hair short in seizing the game in the end - holding the UCONN offense scoreless over the final quarter-and-a-half of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey had a season high in tackles with four as Yale gave UCONN (now 1-7) all it could handle over the second half of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three of Hickey’s tackles were of the solo variety and his four tackles overall were the most in 2021 for the speedster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, the 6-foot-1 junior has nine total tackles to his name, including a half-tackle for a loss of one yard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the loss, Yale fell to 2-3 overall while the Huskies earned its first win of the campaign since defeating UMASS (56-35) back on October 26, 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Current Central standout Victor Rosa will be attending UCONN in the fall as both squads will soon have representatives from the Bristol Central football program.</p>
