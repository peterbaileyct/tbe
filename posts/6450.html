<p>BRISTOL - Bristol American Legion baseball standout Roberto Cruz sure loves to play extra innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a time where the multi-talented athlete always seems to elevate his level of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Saturday, it was all Cruz as he laid down the go-ahead RBI bunt that gave Bristol the lead for good and then shut down the Naugatuck offense from the mound in the eighth as Post 2 snared a huge 6-3 Zone 1 victory from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win moved Bristol to 10-4 overall, 8-4 in Zone play while Naugatuck fell to 4-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was the visiting team because the game was a make-up from Wednesday as rain and thunder postponed the event from Naugatuck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Cruz’s fourth win of the season and he nearly put the event away in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz (2.1 innings, one hit, 4 Ks) came in for Mike Lorenzetti (5.2 innings, two hits, 12 Ks, five walks, two runs) with two outs in the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one on and Bristol leading 2-1, pinch-hitter Jeff Duda smacked a first-pitch double into left as Naugatuck had runners on second and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Cruz attempted to end the inning by picking off Duda at second base, but the ball was thrown away, Mike Rusin scored and going into the seventh, it was a 2-2 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I rolled the dice there,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “Alberto’s had about four pickoffs with that play. He’s usually smart enough to know not to throw it. But I just wanted to take a shot there. And that was the tying run and it didn’t work out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sometimes you roll it, and it doesn’t work.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then in the bottom of the eighth, Post 2 had runners on second and third with Cruz at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a 1-2 count, Cruz dropped in a bunt hit that scored a run, led to another off an error and when all was said and done, Bristol led 4-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I rolled it with a two-strike bunt and it worked,” said LaPenta. “I could have looked like a goat twice, but I figured Roberto is a pretty good bunter and it turned out that was the play of the game really.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We ended up getting two runs on a little bunt.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two runs later, it was a 6-2 game and Post 17 was nearly down and out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck relief pitcher Ryan Tyszka came into throw to open the eighth but was ambushed by Bristol’s line-up - posting four hits - while two Naugatuck errors did not help matters in the least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up losing the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol reached double-figures in hits as Ryan Fradette went 3-of-4 with two RBI to pace the onslaught.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s been hitting all year,” said LaPenta of Fradette. “He’s been hitting great.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette laced a one-hopper with two outs in the top of the first, easily stealing second to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Jack Kozikowski fanned on a full-count to end the inning as Naugatuck came up to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the frame, Anthony Abate earned a one-out walk and with two gone, Derek Jagello (7 IP, two runs, six hits, 11 K, BB, 109 pitches) drew four balls as Post 17 had two runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lorenzetti caught Matt Kilmer looking at strike three as Post 2 wiggled out of an early jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was at it again in the top of the second as Owen Davis drew a base-on-balls with one out - taking second base via a steal - but was stranded in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rusin led off the bottom of the tilt with a walk but Lorenzetti quickly caught fire - fanning the side from there - as the scoreless showdown went into the third inning with Bristol coming to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Brown slipped a bunt hit towards third base to get onboard with one out in the third and then Adam Caron followed with a flare to right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown blasted by second base - putting men on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Fradette launched a ball to left that was dropped by the fielder, easily allowing Brown to score for third as Post 2 zipped up a 1-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck’s Nick Bruno walked to open the bottom of the third and then Mike Deitylbaum smacked a single to center - Naugy’s first hit of the game - as the ‘home’ squad had runners on first and third with one gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Matt Kilmer delivered a hopper by the bag at first base as Bruno tagged the plate - making it a brand new game at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jagello retired the side in order in the top of the fourth while Lorenzetti needed just ten pitches to get out of the bottom of the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown then generated his second consecutive infield hit with one away in the fifth, stealing second and third to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Fradette cashed in as he dropped a base hit into left as Brown scored to give Bristol a 2-1 push midway through the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck had to top of the order up in the bottom of the fifth but Lorenzetti wasn’t having any of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He shut down the line-up in order off an 11-pitch stint, scooped up strikeouts 10 and 11, allowing just the two hits while retiring seven straight as Post 2 maintained its 2-1 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Davis ripped out a one-out single in the top of the sixth but was pinch runner Alex Canzellarini was picked off by Jagello.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, Naugy got out of the inning without yielding a run and Lorenzetti was back at it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He fanned Jagello, got Kilmer to ground out and was able to square off against Rusin before running out of pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rusin walked for the second time as Cruz came in for Lorenzetti with two outs in the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duda laced a double to left to put men on second and third and when the botched pickoff play at second base ended up in centerfield, Rusin scored to tie things up at 2-2 heading into the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams went down in order in the seventh as the Zone 1 challenge was squared up at 2-2 - meaning an extra inning was required to determine the victor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out in the top of the eighth, Fradette unleashed his third hit of the game - a single to left - as Bristol got something brewing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Nohilly then popped a single into short left-center to put two on with one away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz carried a 1-1 count before Tyszka balked, advancing runners to second and third, before nabbing the go-ahead hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He laid down a perfect bunt to the third base side of the mound as Naugatuck had no chance to get Fradette at the plate - making it 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the play, the ball was thrown to first base but no one was on the bag to get the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The errant throw allowed Nohilly to score from third as Bristol racked up a 4-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Davis then unleashed a double to right-centerfield as men were stationed at second and third with just one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a grounder by Tyler Martin, the ball was chucked away at first base, two runners scored on the gaff, and once the dust settled, Bristol held an imposing 6-2 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Those two runs are huge at the end with the error at third base,” said LaPenta. “They’re a good club. They made a little rally there. If we’re only up two runs, and they have [men on] second and third and the go-ahead run is at the plate, it’s a whole pressure scenario.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 17 showed a little gumption to end the game as the first two batters of the frame reached safely - putting the tying runner in the on-deck circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An error at first allowed one run to score but Cruz then struck out the final batter as Bristol was a 6-3 winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They showed a lot of resiliency coming back,” said LaPenta of his squad. “It’s a sign the team is coming together.”</p>
