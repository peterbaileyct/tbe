<p>BRISTOL – After a tough loss to Southington over the previous weekend, the Bristol Eastern girls basketball squad returned to the friendly confines of the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol on Tuesday for a CCC Region B bout against Lewis Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word ‘bout’ certainly applied as the Spartans were overly physical with the Lancers in an attempt for an upset bid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though the visiting aggression held a slim lead at the half, Eastern got its offense churning over the final 16 minutes of play, making critical second half stops along the way, as the home team zipped up a 47-31 victory to move to 4-1 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defeat dropped Mills to 1-4 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters got contributions from all eight players that took the hardwood, led by junior Ciara Collins who was battered the entire evening by Spartan defenders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Collins never gave in, staying aggressive throughout, and came away with a game-high 16 points to go along with eight rebounds, two blocks and five steals as Eastern forced Mills into 25 turnovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cali Doyon excelled on both sides of the ball, cramming in 11 points – hitting three 3s in the process – while rejecting two shots and scooping in a game-high six steals to start several fast break opportunities for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sage Scarritt ended the encounter with six points, team-highs of 11 rebounds and four assists – passing brilliantly in the Lancers outside-in attack – while Eastern generated 10 points from the bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent added five points and three rebounds, Emma Stavens hit a critical fourth quarter 3 – adding five points and two rebounds to the till overall – while Audrey Tice also played well off the pine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alyssa Kehler sprung for a bucket, eight rebounds and two steals while Janessa Gonzalez made her first ever start, coming back from early foul trouble to collect two points, a career-high eight rebounds, and two steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abby Mills led the Spartans with 11 points, Brianna Pelchar scooped in nine while Abby Jankoski added six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills was pesky early, refusing to allow the home squad any kind of significant advantage, but late in the first quarter, Collins cashed in on an offensive rebound and when the guard found Doyon for a blistering 3, Eastern nabbed a 14-9 push after eight minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doyon opened the second frame with a slick pass to Parent, leading to a long-range two, but even with a 16-9 edge in hand with 7:03 remaining in the first half, the Spartans went on a run to seize the lead at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills used a 13-3 run to end the half as Eastern, running good offense, just couldn’t drop the ball in the hoop as a Doyon three-pointer with 4:03 left in the second period was the only basket the Lancers could muster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A three-point play from Abby Mills tied the game at 19-19 late before three points by Lauren Searle gave the Spartans a three-point cushion at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern got the lead back early in the third tilt, eventually settling on a 25-25 stalemate with 4:35 to go in the frame, before the Lancers took ultimate control of the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kehler made a put-back late in the third to give Eastern the lead for good while a steal and hoop by Collins gave the home team a 29-25 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading by two with 1:04 showing on the clock in the third quarter, the Lancers went on a 11-0 run – forcing a bundle of turnovers along the way – as Stavens made two big hoops, found Scarritt for another – and with 5:25 to go, Eastern led 40-27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deficit never fell below 11 the remainder of the showdown as Gonzalez hit a late hoop, Parent canned a basket and a free throw and Collins finished things with two charity tosses as the Lancers moved to 4-1 over the 47-31 victory.</p>
