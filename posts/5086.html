<p>There will be better days ahead for the Bristol Eastern softball squad after a very tough opener on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Lancers debut game against Berlin from Sage Park, a quick lead was erased as the Redcoats put together two big scoring innings to seize ultimate control of the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Eastern fell by an 11-1 final from Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once Berlin’s pitching settled down, the offense took charge of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by one, the Redcoats posted three runs in the second inning and netted another six in the fourth to put the contest out of reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin pitcher Stefanie Poulin gave up a run in the top of the first but dominated from there. The run ended up being unearned thanks to an error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Poulin posted nine strikeouts and walked two over a very good opening debut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Jessica Petit had a tremendous game with a double, a home run and four RBI - going 3-for-3 overall for Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allie Tellier walked to open things up in the first inning and then quickly stole second base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single advanced her to third and Tellier later scored on an error to make it a 1-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the mound, Tellier hung tough into the second inning before things ultimately fell apart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game-winning tally came during that second frame when Poulin and Kylie Lanteri posted back-to-back singles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Petit slammed a ball into the outfield and the race was on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Poulin, Lanteri, and Petit all crossed the plate as the inside-the-park homer made it a 3-1 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the home team never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin slapped six runs onto the scoreboard in the fourth stanza and added two more in the sixth to make it an 11-1 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Eastern’s Jasmine Perez had a big triple while Makayla Antunes added two hits to lead the Lancers’ offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Samantha Policki and Tellier each added the other hits for Eastern.</p>
