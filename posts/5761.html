<p>BRISTOL - While the regular season was shortened a bit for the baseball program at Bristol Central this year, the players were ready to shine when bright lights of the Class L Tournament were turned on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in step one for the Rams, No. 16 Central made several big plays on both sides of the ball to rope up a four-run victory over Farmington (5-1) on Tuesday to keep the postseason going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beating the River Hawks in front of its hometown fans was also a big deal after a regular season filled with injuries, tomfoolery and all the negative elements the pandemic had in store for the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite all of that, the season continues for the boys over at Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You get a ten-win season out of it,” said Ray off the win against Farmington. “You get to play at home [to start the tournament]. It’s only our second game since May 10. For us, coming out here and having that chance with the team was more important than anything. [It’s] getting a chance to play at Muzzy Field, it’s getting a chance to play in a tournament game. That means a lot.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central now draws top-ranked Hand in what should be one of the biggest showdowns in the state on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tigers are 17-2 overall and are ranked fifth in the Gametime CT Top-10 Baseball Poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Hand was bounced out of the SCC Quarterfinals by North Haven (3-1) last week in a major upset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the Class L tournament, the Tigers easily eliminated No. 32 Bunnell of Stratford, 13-2, on Tuesday – advancing to second round play against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that might have been the easy part for the number one seed as everything is lined up perfectly for Central, turning to Michael Lorenzetti on the hill to battle the Tigers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into the game, Lorenzetti’s numbers are impressive as he’s gone 28 innings, producing 61 strikeouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Hand is going to have one heck of a challenge on its hands with the 6-foot-8 chucker on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You know what, this is what we wanted to do,” said Ray of the Central pitching rotation. “I have a #1 and a #1A [level pitcher]. I have two number ones and I said let’s march one of them out [Wininger against Farmington]. I think Mike gives us a good shot to win any game [when] he’s out there. This is where we’re at.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti is looking forward to the showdown and the well-rested pitcher will be giving everything he has against one of the best programs in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[We] gave him an extra day of rest,” said Ray of Lorenzetti. “We had him in the bullpen today. I know he’s going to go out and give us a great effort. We’re going to swing the bats [for him against Hand].”</p>
