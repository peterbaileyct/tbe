<p>BRISTOL – Bristol Eastern boys basketball standout Elijah Parent had some choices to make when it came to his collegiate future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And anyone who saw him take the hardwood over the past four scholastic seasons knew that basketball was going to be in his future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But where would the CCC South, All Conference guard end up once all his cards were put on the table?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, Parent is a scholar-athlete and had multiple schools and institutions to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, was there an option in which he could play basketball, earn a degree, and serve his country all at the same time?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His choice was decided upon a couple weeks ago as Parent will attend the United States Coast Guard Academy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I would like to start off by thanking my parents, sister, grandparents, all my coaches, and teachers, old and new, for demanding my best along the way to get me into the position that I am today,” said Parent via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also went on to thank the many coaches, teachers, and other mentors “for seeing my potential.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That being said, I have decided to accept my appointment to the United States Coast Guard Academy Scholar Program to further my academic and athletic career. I am very excited to have a chance to serve my country.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outstanding young men like Parent are the future of our nation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>America was founded and built by dedicated individuals who understood that leadership, intelligence and dedication to self and country helped make the United States what it has become today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent – who is going to be an outstanding representative serving from the Mum City – will help carry that outstanding tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, why not play a little hoop along the way?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent received his appointment in March but needed a medical waiver to attend which was granted.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The plan for Parent is to go to NAPS (Naval Academy Preparatory School) in Newport, Rhode Island, and then attend the Academy the following year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ten-month course of instruction at NAPS, lasting from August through May, emphasizes preparation in English Composition, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and Information Technology.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then from there, it’s off to the Academy – a place where Parent will surely flourish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s another standout from the Bristol Eastern boys basketball program who decided to help serve his country on the grandest stage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Phelan, who dropped three-point bombs at Bristol Eastern back in the late 1990s, is a Green Beret – dedicating his life to the values and commitments that America holds dear and does so to this day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent chose his service with the Coast Guard and will be hitting three-pointers from all over the court while putting his skills to the test.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combo guard left the Bristol Eastern as the top three-point shooter in program history with 133 makes and holds the school record for most 3-pointers made in a game with seven.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On February 11, 2020, Parent went 7-of-10 from downtown, topping his own record school-trying record of six threes in a game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He mastered the 3-pointer since hitting the hardwood at Bristol Eastern, hitting a slick 6-of-6 in a game against RHAM back on February 1, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent notched over 700 points for his career, ranking him 13<sup>th</sup> all-time in Eastern program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He averaged a team-high 15.7 points-per-game this year, adding 2.5 rebounds and 4.6 assists along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In postseason play, Parent averaged 20.0 points and 6.0 assists-per-game - canning nearly 50-percent of his 3-point attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent was first on the squad in 2-point percentage this season at 48.4-percent - attacking the rim with zest and proving he was more than just an outside shooting force.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 67 career games, Parent hit 84-percent of his free throws - one of the top marks in program history - and averaged 10.6 points-per-game over his career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern will be holding a ceremony to honor the young man on a date to be determined.</p>
