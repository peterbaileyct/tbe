<p>BRISTOL – The winning streak for the Bristol Eastern volleyball team against Bristol Central, now at 53 straight victories by the Lancers, started off quietly in 1995.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before getting to that point in history, Central did very well against Eastern from 1992-94.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams kept Eastern out of the state tournament picture in 1994 via a 3-2 victory that was epic in proportion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That last Central win saw the Rams come back from a 1-0 deficit to post a three-games-to-two triumph over Eastern on November 3.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after the Bristol Eastern volleyball program won the Class L championship in 1991, under the guidance of head coach Gail McMahon (Ericson), Central fared very well against the Lancers over the following six matches off that title victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All but two of the six showdowns went the full five sets while the other two were four-set battles with either program in position to win the match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you went to school at Bristol Eastern during this period, most students - not knowing the history of the city series battles - thought the BC/BE volleyball showdowns were always back and forth affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was hardly the case in the early-to-mid 1990s.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a September 28, 1992 battle against the Rams, Eastern grabbed the first two sets against Central (15-13, 15-10), dropped the next two (6-15, 9-15) which required the squads to play a winner-take-all fifth game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern came away from the event a 15-8 winner, taking the match 3-2 – winning its 12<sup>th</sup> straight contest against Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that all quickly changed for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central took four of the next five matches as the Rams looked poised, sharp and played extremely well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On November 4, 1992, Central broke its losing streak against Eastern, defeating the defending Class L champs by a 3-1 final (15-8, 15-7, 14-16, and 15-12).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first win by the Rams over Eastern since 1986.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory moved the Rams to 10-7 overall while Eastern fell to 9-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams were 7-7 in CCC South confrontations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lisa Korytkowski and Traci Dufour helped Central finally score a win over Eastern while Sarah Killiany, Angela Bookas, Melissa MacDonald and Gayle Zahnke all contributed over the outstanding effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Melissa Fortin, Jessica Byrnes, and Melanie Chapdelaine played well for Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a huge victory for Central coach Gary Fleming as his squads had very little success against the Lancers over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 1993, Central was an even stronger unit and battled Eastern in two five-set wars – the first sweep against the Lancers since 1984.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern returned only Jessica Byrnes – who ended up playing basketball collegiately during her freshman season at the University of New Haven – from the 1991 championship team but the Lancers still pushed the Rams to the brink.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first match took place on October 12 from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium as Central pulled out a 15-10, 11-15, 15-2, 13-15, and 15-13 win over Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kristen Mullin played well at the net and from the service line while Central teammates Jaime Serapilia, Zahnke, and Bookas led the charge for the home team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>April Yetke, Beth Ponte, and Byrnes played well but the Lancers just fell short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, the Rams repeated the feat at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on November 3 with another five-set thriller (18-20, 15-2, 15-11, 11-15, and 15-11) as Central defeated Eastern for the third straight time over a rare regular season sweep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was another nip-and-tuck affair with Eastern having to go for twenty first period points to earn a 1-0 edge in the match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central pulled out all the stops late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bookas added nine kills over the winning effort while Mullin, Serapilia, and Zahnke had another strong showing against their crosstown rival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Byrnes played well over her final home match with 18 kills.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Central team had a heck of a season, going 15-5 overall and ranked ninth in the Class L tournament fray.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams earned a first round bye, defeated Westhill, 3-0, on November 10 before falling to Glastonbury, 3-1, that closed out their season two days later.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in 1993, it was one of those rare times Central’s volleyball squad had a better ledger than the Lancers did (12-6). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern finally got back to the pay window on October 7, 1994 as the Lancers earned a 3-1 set win over Central via scores of 15-7, 15-6, 8-15, and 15-9 - it’s first victory over the Rams since 1992.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ponte led the charge with 16 service points while Shelby Fabrizio and Kelly Pomerenke also played well - moving the Lancers to 5-5 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central fell to 6-3 in the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end Eastern’s season early in 1994, it was another five game war on November 3 the Lancers absolutely needed to get into the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern blasted Central in the first set 15-3, fell in the second 17-15, and took the third game 15-11 to put the Rams on the brink - trailing 2-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central ended the fourth set with a 15-9 victory before finishing the night with a 15-11 fifth and final game win as Eastern was denied a postseason spot for the first time since 1985.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mullin had 19 service points, nine kills, and 12 aces while Danielle Drury added a slick eight aces in the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Gera Birdsey added 25 points and several aces over the losing effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Eastern teams in 1985 and 1994 ended the year at 8-10 – both one win away from a .500 record and playoff qualification.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in the next part of this historic rivalry, Central just couldn’t figure out Eastern in 1995 – a streak of misfortune that lasted over the last 53 matches and into 2021.&nbsp;</p>
