<p>First of all, let me declare that I am not deaf. But, like many men married for more than a few years, my wife begs to differ. Evidently, there are many times in a day when I don’t answer a question or I give my answer several minutes after the question was asked. Of course, June still doesn’t seem to understand that my powers of concentration are so amazing that I don’t hear anything if I am:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>H. Reading the paper or a magazine</p>

<p>You probably get the idea. Luckily, my wife is so understanding that we are still happily married after 43 years, or so she tells me.</p>

<p>We also frequently play “volume ping pong” on the TV. I like the volume set at 20; she prefers 15. I find that at 15, I am almost constantly asking what someone just said, especially in those romances or mysteries where all the characters are whispering to each other. Actually, I can only hear the whispers with the volume at 48.</p>

<p>That brings us to the practice of wearing a mask. Believe me, I do my patriotic duty. I wear my mask everywhere it is required. Stores, schools, any indoor place that asks for compliance. And I will continue, even though I have gotten my two Pfizer vaccinations. I’ll do anything they ask me to. I have to obey the rule; I went to Catholic schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the fact that I wear a mask doesn’t mean I have to like it. Breathing is a lot easier without it, but that is not my primary reason for disliking my mask. Up until this pandemic, I never was really aware of how important it is for a person of my hearing level to actually see someone’s mouth while they are talking. It really does help considerably in understanding what was said.</p>

<p>There are so many times these days where I am conversing with someone, and they will come out with a comment of “mmmimph nabder usdym calidgim.”<br>Now what am I supposed to answer?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I usually nod my head knowingly, and hope the nod alone will suffice. It usually does. But there are times my companion just keeps looking at me, awaiting my reply. Then I have to try to change the subject, or give a generic, harmless reply like, “Wow.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Still, there are the other times when the whole mask issue just gets me in major trouble. About a month ago, I met a close friend at the grocery store, and I asked how she was doing. With her mask on, I thought I heard her say, “My son, Henry, just made the honor role.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I replied with an enthusiastic, “That’s great! Congratulations.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It turns out she really said, “My hemmoroids just flared up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I haven’t heard from her since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really want this pandemic to be over.</p>
