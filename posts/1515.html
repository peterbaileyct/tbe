<p>The Bristol Edition has posted a <u><font color="#000117"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ua64UKDUM_UXMiE7yiWKf40AsflL8UjHnXaZ6LcWvPI/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc: Where to Find Take-Out Food in Bristol </a></font></u>for local Bristol restaurants and eateries to share their information, including hours and specials, as well as instructions for pick-up and/or delivery.</p>
