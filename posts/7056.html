<p>The Bristol Edition will hold a community-wide forum to discuss local news coverage in the Stone House near the new Bicycle Pump Track at Rockwell Park on Thursday, Aug. 12 from 6 to 7:30 p.m. The program is free and open to the public.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition (TBE) is Bristol's independent community online newspaper. Aside from informing people of what is happening in Bristol, TBE makes it part of its mission to develop opportunities for our readers to learn more about journalism and for our readers to share their thoughts about how we should use our resources.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the hour and a half Bristol Edition Forum program, participants will learn about who we are, break up into groups to prioritize coverage over the next six months, reconvene to share what the groups decided, and map out some practical next steps.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone interested in local news coverage is welcome. Participants are asked to bring their own chairs. While it is not mandatory to RSVP, it would be helpful to send an email to editor@bristoledition.org to let us know you will be attending.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you and working with you.</p>
