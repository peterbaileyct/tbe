<p>Back by popular demand, the third installment of the 1995-96 Bristol Eastern boys basketball team as their adventures over a memorable season continues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, last time as you recall, the Lancers lost an 85-62 decision at New Britain High School as Shon Jones went wild - scoring 44 points on 17-of-28 shooting from the field - to help the Hurricanes defeat Eastern back on January 19, 1996. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers fell to 4-6 off the loss and with 10 games remaining, how would the rest of the regular season play out?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would Eastern qualify for the state tournament? Did the program have any shot at a CCC South Championship? Or would Steve Gaudet – and his dastardly lack of scoring – doom his team into hoop oblivion?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, the Lancers ended up rolling off 11 straight wins as the program won its second ever CCC South title – sharing the championship along with Platt of Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern had to battle all the elements to nab its share of the CCC South title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the New Britain loss, Eastern spun Southington by a 61-43 final on January 23 as Shawn Paul and Dave Giovinazzo led the squad with 13 points apiece.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Giovinazzo either led or co-led the program in scoring in eight of the 11 games that the Lancers consecutively won.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, against Southington that night, Jon Kozlak hit two threes, scoring 12 points, while James Augustine added eight over the winning effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chris Willis came off the pine for a big rebounding effort while ‘crafty’ Keith Viens (who fouled everything in sight) brought his explosive defensive effort to the court - helping the Lancers win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then three days later, Eastern and Bristol Central went at it in the first city series tilt of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, Giovinazzo notched 18 points and Kozlak added 11 as the Lancers won the home game, 51-43.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late free throws sealed the deal over the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central fell to 3-8 overall as Sean Gauvin led his squad with 15 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Lancers won eight of those 11 games during the streak by eight points or less as the program showed ability to, not only read the carefully planned scouting reports written up by head coach Mike Giovinazzo, but to close out and win those contests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Bulkeley, in a revenge game on January 30 from the Babe Allen Field House in Hartford, Eastern was able to topple the Bulldogs by a 51-47 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed by eight at intermission but made all the big shots late to claim the victory on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jim Deschaine, the self-proclaimed box-and-one expert (remember Plainville, Jimmy?) dropped in a team-high 12 points - all over second half play - while Tim Tycz and Giovinazzo added 10 points apiece.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the to open the month of February, the Lancers sank Maloney, 56-48, as Giovinazzo scored 17 points and Deschaine kicked in 14.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Paul collected a double-double of 11 points and 11 rebounds while Tycz slipped in 10 as the Lancers moved to 8-6 overall - qualifying for the postseason in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern went for its fifth straight win on February 6, snaring a huge 58-52 victory against Platt in Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shawn Paul dropped 20 points on the Panthers while Giovinazzo hit for 17 for the second consecutive contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on February 9, a trip to Newington produced a 49-38 victory as Eastern - after that miserable 4-6 start - moved to 10-6 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the program’s sixth straight victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giovinazzo equaled his season-high of 22 points while snaring 12 rebounds in a big-time showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds while Kozlak sank home eight as the Lancers were on a roll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will pause here, halfway through the Lancers’ 11-game winning streak, and next week, it will the exciting conclusion of the 1995-96 campaign as Eastern ended up battling the top team in Connecticut during postseason play.</p>
