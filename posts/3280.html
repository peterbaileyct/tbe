<p>FARMINGTON - The Bristol Central girls cross country team battled Farmington on Wednesday afternoon, getting a very good effort from several of its runners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the end, the Indians were too tough to overcome as the Rams fell 23-38 from the course at Winding Trails in Farmington.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First place went to Central’s Natalia Popielarz - an extremely talented senior who ended the race in 20:13 over a finish that wasn’t even close.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington’s Ella Szczepanski was the runner up in 21:31 while teammate Anna Weygang took third place in 22:10.</p>

<p> Then there was veteran Bella Crandall, making a fourth place finish for the Rams in 22:46.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indians took the next five slots in the challenge but to round out the top 10, the Rams’ Johannie Juarez earned tenth place in 25:58.</p>
