<p><strong><em><br></em></strong>Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu and Assessor Tom DeNoto have announced that homeowner tax relief programs in Bristol are impacted by the Governor’s Executive Order #10 issued earlier last week. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Homeowners who are already in our system for the Homeowners Elderly/Disabled Circuit Breaker program do not have to reapply,” said DeNoto. “This will eliminate the need for paperwork and visits to City Hall. The only people who have to apply for this program are new applicants to the program.” The <strong>deadline for new applicants is May 15<sup>th</sup>.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This means that people in the program are going to maintain their benefits for the next year,” said Mayor Zoppo-Sassu. “With the uncertainty of the economy due to Covid19, we want to make sure Bristol residents, especially those on fixed incomes,&nbsp;are aware of this program and this change.”</p>

<p>This waiver also applies to those homeowners who apply for the Senior Volunteer Tax Credit program which allows for a $300 tax credit for those who volunteer and meet certain income guidelines. The documentation of complete volunteer hours still needs to be submitted. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the Senior Tax Relief program that the City Council voted on last year, which issued a $125 credit on real estate and applied it directly to the tax bills, is still available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Assessor also noted that those in the program who may have had a substantial decrease&nbsp;in &nbsp;income&nbsp;should contact the Assessor’s Office to show their documentation. ”If you have less income, this may increase the benefit and amount a homeowner can be saving,” said DeNoto.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Governor Lamont’s Executive Order excludes the stimulus payments from these benefits. So for those people who are on the edge of eligibility, receiving the $600 stimulus check last year will not count against their income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Veterans exemption is still available. If you are already in the program, you are all set. If you want to apply, the deadline for doing so is October 1<sup>st</sup>. </p>

<p>The Assessor’s Office is open from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM Monday thru Friday. The office phone number is 860-584-6240.   For essential information regarding these programs, to print forms and or apply, please visit the Assessor’s Page at <a href="http://www.bristolct.gov/assessor">www.bristolct.gov/assessor</a>.  <br>​​​​​ </p>
