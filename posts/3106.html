<p>The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team (4-3-1) got above .500 for the first time this year after beating Plainville (1-7)  2-0 Thursday afternoon. The Lancers capped off a busy week at 3-0, beating New Britain and Avon on Monday and Tuesday. </p>

<p>Similarly to their first meeting with the Blue Devils, the Lancers struck early as Megan Krok played a great ball to a pressing Emily Nelson. Nelson took over from there, beating a Plainville defender and tucking it in the net to give the Blue and Grey a 1-0 lead just over 7 minutes into the action. <br></p>

<p>Plainville responded with physicality that continued throughout the afternoon. Both teams fought hard in the middle of the field which led to a lot of back and forth action.</p>

<p>However, the deciding factor in the game was the Bristol Eastern defense of Kate Kozikowski, Audra Porowski, Cecelia Gilbert, Maura Cyr and Mikayla Gonzalez, backed up by Grace D'Amato in goal (4 saves). The Lancer defense stymied any Plainville attack and earned a clean sheet.  <br></p>

<p>The Lancers scored their second goal 11 minutes after the first and it was a beauty. Emma Stavens won the ball in the attacking third of the field. She delivered a crisp pass to Breanna Venturo-Nelson who corralled it quickly with a quick touch inside and blasted a shot from 25 yards out over the keeper's head into the far upper corner. <br></p>

<p>The second half saw a lot of physicality, and many chances for BE, but nothing came to fruition as the Lancers were content getting out of Plainville with the win and ending a busy a week of action. <br></p>
