<p>It was two evenly matched foes battling it out all afternoon. The Blue and Grey came out with a ton of energy and set the tone from the start. Ten minutes into the game, the 0-0 tie was broken. Ciara Collins won a goal kick in the air and headed it forward. Megan Krok came in from the outside to pressure the Avon defender receiving the ball and poked it back to Collins. Upon receiving the ball, she fired a laser from about 35 yards out over the Avon goalkeeper's head, putting the Lancers up 1-0. </p>

<p>The remainder of the half saw some chances for both teams but nothing of high quality. Just before the half ended, Cecelia Gilbert won the ball from an Avon attacker. She stepped forward and delivered a great pass  to Emma Stavens. Stavens laid it off beautifully to Emily Nelson. Nelson did the rest as she fired a left footed shot from distance, once again beating the Avon goalkeeper up high and giving the Lancers all they would need to secure a victory. Immediately after the goal, the halftime whistle was blown and the two teams would head to break with BE leading 2-0. </p>

<p>The second half continued to be an evenly, hard fought match by both teams, but with less excitement on the scoresheet as the Lancers and Falcons played the second 40 minutes without a score. The BE defense of Kate Kozikowski, Audra Porowski, Cecelia Gilbert, Maura Cyr, and Mikayla Gonzalez, along with Grace D'Amato (9 saves) in goal, held on for the clean sheet after a barrage of chances throughout the second half. </p>
