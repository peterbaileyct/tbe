<p>A CCC, Region B All-Conference nod went out to Bristol Eastern boys basketball standout Elijah Parent this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior guard deserved the recognition as the shooting sensation wrapped up his final season as a four-time varsity standout for the Lancers with a big postseason burst.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a wild season for the Kingstreeters, coached by Bunty Ray, interrupted by the pandemic before things even got off the ground while a two-week quarantine attempted to derail things entirely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Parent and company never folded and despite a 3-9 final ledger, the team never stopped competing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent, the program’s point guard, was the leading scorer for the Lancers in 2021 - averaging 15.7 points and 4.6 assists-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also canned a team-leading 31 three-point field goals this year and is the all-time leader in the program history with 133 trifectas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent scored 18 or more points six times this season, breaking the 20-point barrier in three games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He dished out nine assists in the 62-53 tourney victory over South Windsor while tallying six-plus assists in four games over 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of three-point marksmanship, the shooter hit four three-pointers in a game this year five times and drained a season-high five 3s in that big win over South Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent turned it on over his last three contests, hitting 12 combined threes while dropping in 23-of-44 field goals overall (52.3-percent).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The postseason was very good for the senior as he averaged 20.0 points, 6.0 assists, 3.0 rebounds, and 1.5 steals-per-game over two contests in the fourth bracket of CCC Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, his 21-point performance at Hartford Public on March 25 was a season-high for Parent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And another stat that stands out for Parent is his 3.9 GPA in the classroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even after all the points and three-point bombs, that GPA is his most impressive number he carries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there is a collegiate future for the combo guard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent has looked at schools such as Rivier University in Nashua, New Hampshire and Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t be surprised if Parent ends up at a certain Coast Guard Academy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wherever he goes, the standout is going to have a chance to play a little basketball while earning his degree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern senior Josh Kolano also had an outstanding senior season and could have made the all-conference team but fell a bit short in the voting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He put up very good numbers in his one and only season at Eastern, averaging 10.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 1.2 steals-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kolano was second on the squad with 24 three-pointers and was tops on the Eastern program in rebounds (82).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his best game in an Eastern uniform, Kolano helped the Lancers defeat South Windsor in that postseason showdown, zipping up a team-season high of 25 points - hitting six three-pointers along the way - while scooping in 12 rebounds which was one off his career best.</p>
