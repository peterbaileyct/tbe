<p>Will the Bristol American Legion baseball team ever play a game again this year?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mother Nature hasn’t been Post 2’s friend as of late as Bristol’s last two games have been halted by tomfoolery.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals attempted to get its contest in on Saturday against Berlin despite the lousy weather and had big Mike Lorenzetti ready to go on the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if the rain didn’t stop the game, what did?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin did not have enough players to field a team that day, forfeiting the game in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Lorenzetti’s first win of the campaign (1-1).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after the holiday break, Post 2 was looking to get back into the swing of things, taking on Naugatuck in a Zone 1 contest from Naugatuck high school.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A victory would have gotten Bristol closer to second place in the Zone 1 standings but as 5 p.m. approached that evening, the skies immediately darkened.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Post 17 (Naugatuck) had just completed batting practice, but the wind picked up in intensity – even blowing a hat off a player or two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quickly, Florida style lighting was seen in the area and minutes later, the facility was pounded by rain.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There wasn’t any chance to start the game as Bristol players scurried to their cars as the rain was coming down in sheets.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The temperature – which was in the 90s before the precipitation – dropped twenty degrees or so, but getting the contest in simply was not in the cards. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game will be made up on a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rust or rest?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has played only one game in July, back on the first of the month, as Post 2 dropped a tough 9-4 decision to Meriden from Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Lozier threw 92 pitches over 5.2 innings of work – earning a no-decision for his efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But due to the pitch count rules, he could not throw again until July 6 and since that date has come and gone, every chucker from Post 2 is eligible to throw now.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If games suddenly start to cluster up due to unpredictable weather and postponements, Bristol will need all hands on deck from the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Standings&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If all the records for Zone 1 are up to date, Post 2 is not far off the lead in the division.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top five squads in Zone 1 are West Hartford (7-2 Zone 1, 8-2 overall), Meriden (6-2, 6-3), Bristol (7-4, 9-4), Avon (5-3), and Naugatuck (4-3).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking a closer look at the standings, Bristol is just a game behind West Hartford and a half-game in back of Meriden for second place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Avon is on a half-game behind Post 2 for third place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Next Game&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals are scheduled to host Newington on Thursday at 7 p.m. from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington is dangerous at 3-5 and gave Bristol a run for its money back on June 20 from Legend’s Field as Post 2 broke a 3-3 stalemate in the eighth inning – propelling the team to a 5-3 victory as Roberto Cruz won in relief.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that Newington contest, Simsbury is in town on Sunday at 1 p.m. – also from Muzzy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juniors hitting Muzzy Field for two</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol junior squad, after battling Newington on Wednesday (5:30 p.m., Riley Field), will play its next two games from Muzzy Field in doubleheaders with the senior crew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday at 5 p.m., the juniors take on Newington and then on Sunday, after the seniors game, Post 2 get the second contest against Simsbury with a 3:30 p.m. start.</p>
