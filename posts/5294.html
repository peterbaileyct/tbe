<p>MERIDEN - Bristol Central’s softball squad has done quite well over its first seven games of the 2021 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have a fantastic mix of veterans and newcomers and against Platt on Friday, Central earned its third shutout of the season as the Panthers fell by a 6-0 push in a CCC South tilt from Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central moved to 5-2 overall over the winning effort while Platt evened its ledger at 4-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the Rams’ third win over the past four games and the program’s first road victory since shutting out Hartford Public back on April 19 (18-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the shutout belonged to sophomore pitcher Alex Sciarretto as she scored another victory in the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alex pitched another great game,” said Central coach Monica Hayes via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She collected nine strikeouts, but she was just as lethal batting from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Sciarretto blasted out a triple and netted two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto was obviously a defensive standout for Central but the team had stars all around the field making plays over a very windy day of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sophia Toresso, Kaley Laird, and Lorelei Stancavage had great defensive efforts,” said Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have a chance to qualify for the state tournament next week if the squad can sweep their schedule of three games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, May 3, Central squares off against Tolland while on Friday, the Rams make a trip to West Hartford to battle Conard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before that, Wednesday is a big day for the program as the annual city series clash against Bristol Eastern takes place on Wednesday, May 5 from the softball field on King Street.</p>
