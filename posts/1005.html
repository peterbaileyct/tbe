<p><em>Note: For proposes of disclosure, David Fortier worked with David Watson, Stan O'Donnell and John Cyr to produce the following, which the band is using for a press release announcing their latest success.</em></p>
<h5>By David Fortier</h5>
<p>It took him until he turned 60, but David Watson, aka, Rikki of The Rikki Aaron Band, signed his first recording contract this summer with a London label.</p>
<p>“The lifelong feat would have never happened without the efforts and guidance of the original co-founders of the semi-famous band Motown Revue, Stanley O’Donnell and John Cyr,” Watson said.</p>
<p>Watson said that Roual Galloway of Cordial Recordings approached O’Donnell, asking where he could find more music from the Rikki Aaron Band and whether the band could produce a whole album.</p>
<p>“I had the material,” Watson said. “I just needed a manager to manage all of the legal aspects, Stanley, who has always been key in my music career, because I was in his Motown band, called John and so the ball began to roll.”</p>
<p>Cyr took on manager duties, navigated a record contract, got songs copyrighted and prepared his studio for two last songs that had to be completed, Watson said.</p>
<p>Watson, who is a Bristol native, as are O’Donnell and Cyr, now resides in Florida. To complete the album, the three exchanged files via the internet. Watson flew up from Florida for at least one session. Cyr, working from Cyreous Music Studios, along with O’Donnell, produced the final recording. Watson signed Aug. 1.</p>
<p>“Roual told us that this style of music is very popular in Europe,” said Watson. The album will be available from iTunes and Amazon Music this March.</p>
<p>Watson a.k.a. Rikki, is the writing talent and main musical contributor, while Stan O’Donnell a.k.a. Aaron plays drums and sings throughout. Cyr was tapped to be the sound engineer and manager.</p>
<p>Playing soul music is not new for any of these guys. They had a stint playing in O’Donnell’s locally famous soul band “Motown Revue.” They opened for such acts as the Temptations, the Four Tops, Tower of Power, the Chi-lites, the Marvelettes, Wilson Pickett, the Fabulous Rhinestones among other impressive soul bands.</p>
<p>The band was forced to change its name back in the late 80’s when it became a New England phenomenon and Motown Records felt threatened by its Motown sound.</p>
<p>“If you ever danced, or visited the club scene from 1986 on, you inevitably heard of the group,” said Cyr.</p>
<p>This record deal came as a result of the songs being accidentally heard by some German promoter who bought one of the singles from Watson for $600.</p>

<p>“The songs ‘For the Love of Music’ and ‘Say What’s On Your Mind’ (released in 1981 as a single for the year of disabled people) has been floating around the internet on some record club websites for some time,” said O’Donnell.</p>
<p>A London record producer, Roual Galloway, heard the songs and tried anxiously to reach the composers. Galloway also runs a vinyl record store, Love Vinyl, that features great soul sounds from the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s.</p>
<p>Love Vinyl rides the wave of the new resurgence for vinyl records hitting England at this time.</p>
<p>“Our songs have a special sound to them which is somewhat like the soul songs you heard back then, but with an East Coast flair,” said Watson.</p>
<p>Stan contacted Cyr, a local musician and recording studio owner after Cyr moved back from Oregon.</p>
<p>“Something told me to contact Cyr again. It was something in the air that moved me to do this, a spiritual force of some kind,” said O’Donnell. “Once I got a hold of John, everything started to click and doors started to open.”</p>
<p>“These are great songs,” said Cyr. “Someone should do something about getting these published.”</p>
<p>Cyr copyrighted the songs and obtained the necessary ISRC codes to protect Rikki Aaron’s interests. He handled the negotiations with Galloway.</p>
<p>“I am glad to say, Rikki Aaron now has a signed contract with this London promoter,” Cyr said.</p>
<p>“We are looking at a release date of March of 2019,” said Watson.</p>
<p>O’Donnell said he remembers the old days when Watson and he started double drumming in the “Rufus Blues Band,” “RBB &amp; Co.” and others.</p>
<p>“I believed in the kid’s talent,” O’Donnell said, “and I knew that Davey’s music had to be heard around the world.”</p>
<p>The contract includes publishing and world-wide distribution through every possible media outlet and music format around the world, including possible European tours.</p>
<p>The songs on the album are “Say What’s On Your Mind,” the hit lead single, “For the Love of Music,” “Save the World--Part 1 and 2,” “Hey Girl,” “The Dream,” “Will You,” “Gigi,” “I’m a Young Man,” “Think Fast” and “Brighter Days.”</p>
