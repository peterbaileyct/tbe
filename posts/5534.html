<p>The Central Connecticut State University softball team earned several major awards this week, announced by the Northeast Conference offices on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s an award-winning staff at CCSU as coaches Breanne Gleason, Pat Holden, and Alexis Debrosse were recognized as the Coaching Staff of the Year by the Northeast Conference for 2021. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Gleason and her staff presided over a significant turnaround in 2021,” according to a release from the Northeast Conference. “After a ninth-place finish in 2019, CCSU went 20-8 vs. NEC foes to take third [place] this spring.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gleason came to Central Connecticut State University following two seasons on the coaching staff at the University of New Haven. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gleason has won 153 games, including a Northeast Conference championship, through seven-plus seasons as head coach at CCSU - good for a .500 record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was her outstanding playing career for the Chargers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gleason led the program at New Haven to three straight NCAA Tournament appearances, including the program's best postseason run in 2010. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individually, Gleason finished her career as New Haven’s all-time leader in at-bats, doubles, pitching appearances, strikeouts, wins and innings pitched.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gleason was a two-time Third Team All-America selection, a four-time Daktronics All-Region selection and in 2010, she earned both the Player of the Year and Pitcher of the Year Awards from the Northeast-10 Conference.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She became just the second player to earn both honors in the same collegiate season. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gleason was the 20th Division II pitcher to record 1,000 career strikeouts (1,098 overall in 171 appearances) and the 22nd to reach 100 victories (106). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Bristol Central, Gleason dominated from the hill – going 60-11 for the Rams over her last three scholastic seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She struck out 654 batters over that time frame and her worst ERA was a 0.74 clip during her sophomore campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prior to CCSU, assistant coach Pat Holden spent 10 years (2005-15) working for Little League International and the Little League World Series. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From 2007-2015, he also coached baseball at St. Paul Catholic High School - putting the pieces of a program together that eventually won a state championship. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holden posted a record of 99-78 through nine campaigns as the mentor of the Falcons’ outstanding baseball program.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2011, Holden’s squad won the Naugatuck Valley League Championship and holds the school record for most wins in a single season (20-6) which was accomplished in 2015. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He graduated from CCSU in 2004 where he played four seasons on the baseball team, helping the program to win NEC Championships in 2002, 2003, and 2004 &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holden posted a combined playing record of 136-79-3 and spent one season as volunteer coach under current CCSU baseball coach Charlie Hickey in 2005. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Post-season awards are well-received, and we are all grateful for them,” said Holden via Twitter. “This is about our squad, families, alums, supporters, and staff members. And it’s about the next game.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central went 20-8 in NEC play this season – going 23-15 overall – and earned the No. 3 seed in the NEC Softball Tournament.&nbsp;</p>
