<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern baseball team has been absolutely snake bitten this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 0-7 record the program carries is about as bogus as it gets because Eastern was on the cusp of winning more than a couple games this season before one late, bad inning unraveled everything – keeping the Lancers from getting to the pay window to date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s exactly what happened against Lewis Mills on Monday afternoon as the visitors scored four runs in the top of the eighth inning to snare an 8-4 victory over the Lancers from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans moved to 2-5 off the winning effort while Eastern remains winless.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern trailed 4-3 going into the bottom of the seventh with two outs on the board before late heroics staved off the seven-inning defeat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan Woodsome started the rally by lining a single to center, Andrew Lozier drew a walk&nbsp;while a&nbsp;two-strike single up the middle from Tyler Stickels plated Woodsome to tie the game at 4-4 – forcing an extra frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the top of the eighth, Mills made all the big plays offensively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern reliever Cole Latko walked the first two batters in the tilt as Ryan Maglio eventually took over on the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Spartans’ Alec Varano laid a perfect bunt down the third base line for a base hit, loading the bases with no outs.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio retired the next two batters he faced but walked Evan Niziolek on a full count, forcing in the eventual go-ahead run that made it 5-4.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lewis Mills’ Scott Groleau followed with a single to right to score two and one final run came across on a bad throw from the outfield to propel the visitors to an 8-4 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evan Reynolds led the Spartans offense with a two-run single while Groleau had one of his own two-RBI hit over that fateful eighth inning. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting pitcher Brenden Baiardi threw into the sixth, striking out ten – including nine Ks over the first 13 batters he faced to keep Eastern off the bases early on in things.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baiardi also walked two, allowed four hits and three runs but posted a no-decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Niziolek pitched the final 2.2 innings to earn the victory in relief for Mills.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ryan Fradette generated two hits, including a two-run double in the sixth, while Nate Ouellette added in two singles to pace the offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was scoreless through the first three innings as Baiardi allowed just one hit over his first four frames.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern starter Logan Schenck pitched two scoreless innings to open the showdown and left the contest for Dylan Woodsome who got some work in for the Lancers on the mound.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills scored the game’s first run in the top of the fourth to make it a 1-0 affair.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evan Niziolek singled to right, then stole second base to get into scoring position and with two gone, Jacob Dorman lined a single to right to plate the lead runner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern quickly tied things up at 1-1 in the bottom of the fifth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Nohilly singled between short and third but was forced out at second base on Gabe Bartolome's grounder via a fielder’s choice.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bartolome then stole second, went to third on a wild pitch, and scored when Jaydon Churchill's soft liner dropped into right center for a hit, making it a 1-1 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the sixth, the Spartans snared three runs to grab a 4-1 push.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A two-base outfield error, followed by a single from Brice Waldron, scored a runner to make it a 2-1 contest. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then an error in the infield, followed by a hit-by-pitch, loaded the bases for the visiting aggression. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reynolds then flashed a two-run single between short and third to make it a three-run affair. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern came back with two runs in the bottom of the sixth to get within one at 4-3.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infield error and a single from Ben D'Amato put two runners on with just one out.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Niziolek then relieved Baiardi but the new pitcher could not stop the damage.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ouellette singled to left to load the bases and Fradette then made the relief pitcher pay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He smashed a two-run double over the left fielder's head as Eastern trailed 4-3 heading into the final inning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers generated one final run in the seventh to move the game into the extra frame before things fell apart.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even down four runs in the bottom of the eighth, the Lancers attempted to rally.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had two runners on as a single by Fradette and a base-on-balls from Nohilly put the tying run in the on-deck circle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Niziolek retired the next two batters he faced to seal the win for Lewis Mills as the bad luck continued for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
