<p>Tuesday morning, as rainfall intensified, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu discussed the effects of Tropical Storm Henri and the proactive steps Bristol has taken to alleviate any possible flooding concerns from heavy storms at a news conference in the center of Forestville by the Pequabuck River.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They were joined by department heads on location at Thomas W.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Quinlan Forestville Veterans Park.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor stated that she was touring the Western region of Connecticut and was pleased with the response to the storm by Bristol and other entities, like Eversource, who she said was much better prepared for the storm this year after several problems in the past.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lt. Gov. Bysiewicz stressed that people should use common sense in dealing with a strong storm, should not drive through large bodies of standing water, should not attempt to swim or boat in a fast-moving river, and should stay away from downed power lines.</p>

<p>Robert Longo, Superintendent of the Water and Sewer Department, explained how the reservoirs were drained of their 100 percent capacity so they would not overflow into the brooks and streams that flow into the Pequabuck River. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the reservoirs were allowed to stay at 100 percent, Mr. Longo stated, a major storm could result in flooding of the Pequabuck in troublesome areas like Forestville center, where serious flooding has occurred in the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray Rogozinski, Public Works Superintendent, explained how the city tracks the height of the Pequabuck to know when it has reached a dangerous level. There is a tracking station on the River that measures its height above normal levels. Mr. Rogozinski said that a burst of several inches in a short span is much more dangerous than more rain spread out over 24 hours or even a few days.</p>
