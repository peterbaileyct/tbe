<p>BRISTOL - Bristol softball ruled the day on Wednesday and the program from Central was not an exception to that edict.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its 2021 debut, the Rams were able to topple Simsbury by a 11-0 final from the softball field at Bristol Central in CCC Interdivisional play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore pitcher Alex Sciarretto was the real deal in the circle and made her first ever start from the mound a memorable one against the Trojans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She threw a two-hitter while the defense helped her out along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Janessa Bartell and Sophia Torreso solidified the defense with big plays all afternoon,” said Central head coach Monica Hayes via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also credited her offense as just about everyone got into the swing of things from the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hits [were] up and down the line-up,” said Hayes. “Great start to the season.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it will be the only game of the week as Central is gearing up for several games, starting on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all, Central tackles three games next week, starting with a trek to Hartford Public for a CCC Interdivisional encounter against the Owls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on Wednesday, the Rams are back home in CCC South action against Lewis Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Friday, April 23, it’s the game of the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central goes on the road to battle Southington in a can’t miss CCC Interdivisional confrontation from the Southington high school softball varsity field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time for all three contests is 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>JV wins against Simsbury as well</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s JV softball team was victorious as well, posting an 18-12 triumph in what was termed as ‘a giant comeback win.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was originally scheduled to be played at Central but due to poor field conditions, the contest was moved to Casey Field.</p>
