<p>The Coronavirus specimen collection station on the Bristol Hospital campus closed at 10:30 a.m. this morning, according the hospital spokesman Christopher Boyle in a phone conversation this afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The station is limiting tests to 40 a day, he said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been very lucky with the special collection kits,”
Boyle said. “But they have been decreasing and we are not sure when we are
going to get another supply.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first day of limiting the number of tests was Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since March 13, when it opened, he said, the station has collected around 1,100 specimens, mostly for the public but also for in-patients, emergency personnel and staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a separate initiative, Boyle said, the supply of
isolation gowns used to protect staff is dwindling. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effort, coordinated by Julie Belanger, hospital donation
manager, seeks volunteers to sew gowns from materials that are available locally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People have been wonderful,” Boyle said. “They are always asking
what they can do to help.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone interested in helping with gown project should
contact Belanger at 860-261-6384 or via email at <a href="mailto:jbelanger@bristolhospital.org">jbelanger@bristolhospital.org</a>.</p>
