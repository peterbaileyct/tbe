<p>The City of Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth &amp; Community Services (BPRYCS) is pleased to announce a charitable donation in the amount of $50,000 from the Robert R. Rosenheim Foundation to help support the Parent &amp; Child Program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The Parent &amp; Child Program is operated by the Community Services division of BPRYCS and strives to support Bristol families by providing resources, programs, and services that assist parents in raising healthy and happy children.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The donation to BPRYCS Parent &amp; Child Program was announced at the end of December. Like many organizations and nonprofits, the Parent and Child Program and the Youth &amp; Community Services division has been impacted by hardships in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With facilities and shelters being closed or operating by appointment only, limited child care options, income hardships, and new mandates as COVID numbers grow, the Parent and Child Program has seen an increase in referrals, caseloads, and individuals and families with increasing needs.</p>

<p>City of Bristol Mayor, Ellen Zoppo-Sassu stated, “When the City and Bristol Hospital worked together to ensure that the Parent &amp; Child Center could continue under the City umbrella last summer, we only had partial funding in place. We knew the need was there and we were committed to making it happen. This charitable gift from the Rosenheim Foundation came at exactly the right time to ensure that we can focus on the program and the clients without worrying about short-term funding.”<br><br>The Youth &amp; Community Services division is working to meet those needs in the Bristol community by providing mental and emotional mediation programs, financial assistance programs, feeding children and families, housing at-risk populations, and supporting children with virtual learning, among many other traditional and emergency services.<br><br>Use of the donated funds is specifically expected to help ease staffing pressures, support more Bristol residents, and expand essential service offerings.</p>

<p> “We will also have the opportunity to provide more needed supplies for our caring closet such as diapers, clothing, baby wash and other necessary supplies to support families and newborns,” said Stephen Bynum, Youth &amp; Community Services Supervisor. "Thank you to the Robert R. Rosenheim Foundation and its employees for the Bristol community and affirming the work of the Parent and Child Center.”</p>

<p>“It is very exciting for the Youth &amp; Community Services division to receive such a wonderful donation for the Parent and Child Program,” said Dr. Joshua Medeiros, Superintendent of BPRYCS. “We are hopeful that with donations like these, more residents and community members will be aware of the services available.”</p>
