<p><a>BRISTOL – The Berlin baseball team got the jump over Bristol Eastern on Monday, scooping up a 9-1 edge through three-and-a-half innings before snaring a 12-8 victory from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Berlin’s first win of the year (1-1) while Eastern fell to 0-2 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin dropped in 14 hits for the game, three by Kasey Ouellette which included a triple and three RBI and two hits apiece from Jamie Palmese, Justin Piskorski, Pat Lukens, and Matt Kozak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kozak earned the win for the Redcoats, though the Lancers started to heat up late in the game before running out of innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Andrew Lozier&nbsp;has a perfect day at the plate, tallying&nbsp;two home runs, two walks, three runs scored, and four RBI over another outstanding performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Moore picked up the loss for the Lancers on the hill while&nbsp;Logan Schenck threw in relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the first inning of action, Berlin went ahead 1-0 on an RBI single by Ouellette but the home team had an immediate response to tie things up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier canned his first home run to right center, smashing the ball over the fence at the famed ‘Clem Dome’ to make it a 1-1 affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But very quickly, the Redcoats took control of the contest for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second inning, Berlin’s Ben Schutz walked, stole second, went to third on a wild pitch, and scored on&nbsp;an RBI double by Jamie Palmese and on an RBI single from Justin Piskorski, the visitors led it, 3-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in the third frame, RBI hits by Pat Lukens and Kozak posted Berlin to a 5-1 advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the fourth, the Redcoats turned the showdown into a bit of a blowout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Rice singled to start the rally, then stole second and third base before scoring on an Ouellette single over second base, making it a 5-1 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a walk, Moore was relieved by Schenck who was stuck in a tough spot.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lukens then blasted out a two-run single, a bouncer between third base and shortstop,&nbsp;and later in the frame, a couple of fielder's choices and an error allowed the fourth run to score and suddenly, Berlin’s cushion grew to eight at 9-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers’ offense started to churn a little bit to make it a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fourth, after Kozak had retired eight straight batters, Lozier walked with one gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Singles by Ben D'Amato and Tyler Stickels loaded bases for Cameron Moore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moore nabbed a base hit to center, plating Lozier, and when Stickels rounded second base a bit too far, Berlin made a play to get him going back to the bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stickels ended up returning safely, D'Amato scored on the play,&nbsp;and through four innings, Eastern was trailing 9-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the bottom of the fifth, the Lancers trimmed the deficit to 9-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill reached base on an error to start things off and with two outs,&nbsp;Lozier flipped out his second home run of the game – again hitting a ball over the right/centerfield fence – to make it a four-run game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Redcoats added three insurance runs in the sixth to make it a seven-run contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two infield hits, followed by a two-run double to right by Justin Piskorski, stretched out the deficit and a sacrifice fly by Rice put Berlin in front, 12-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the sixth inning, Eastern scored three runs on just two hits to trim the Berlin tally to 12-8.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out, Stickels struck out on a pitch in the dirt but made it to first base safely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then with two gone, an infield error put runners on first and third for Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill later smoked a single to right for an RBI while a second run scored on a poor relay throw.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the scoring, a base-on-balls, and an infield single by Ryan Fradette loaded up the bases before a Lozier walk forced in the third run of the inning, making it 12-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern saw the tying run come to the plate but that big hit never materialized and, in the end, the Lancers fell by four runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…&nbsp;Lozier has been playing extremely well over his first two games of the season. He has smoked out two triples and two home runs to date.</p>
