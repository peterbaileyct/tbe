<p>HARTFORD - The 28th ranked Bristol Eastern boys basketball team finished the 2021 fighting to the end, dropping a tough 59-51 decision on the road to #25 Hartford Public in a CCC bracket four tournament showdown on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Owls, the top ranked squad in the bracket, entered its contest against Eastern with a bye and was well rested for their showdown with the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was only a 55-49 game with 2:15 to play but the Lancers (3-9) ran out of gas trying to keep up with Public (4-9).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s an athletic team and obviously, you have to make plays against them,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray. “I just think we wore down.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had to chase every player that wore a Hartford Public uniform as the home team showed remarkable balance offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abdul Sani led the Owls with 14 points, Nashaun Hill added 13, Jacquell Harris and Wayne Martin nabbed nine apiece while Ehijha Perry scored eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Elijah Parent ended his career with 21 points, three assists and three steals - notching 16 points over the first half of action to keep things close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s our scorer, he’s our guy,” said Ray of Parent. “He’s got to have a good night for us to be in the game and he did. He gave us a chance to stay in the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Josh Kolano scored nine points and grabbed three rebounds to end a successful one-year stint on the squad, Tyler Donohue had a great finish with eight points and five rebounds while Nasir Walker was everywhere on the court (six points, four assists, six steals).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One senior, that’s all we’ve got” next season said Ray. “We’ve got to build with young kids but I like what the one senior who’s coming back did. Down the stretch, I thought Nasir played extremely well. He gives us a lot of energy. He’s expending a lot of energy out there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When he plays tired, sometimes he makes mistakes but he gets tired because he works so hard to get to that point.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trini Otero added five points and three rebounds, Dylan Woodsome scooped in a team-high seven rebounds, while Brayden Dauphinais scored a hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Nohilly provided excellent defense over his 12 minutes of play that included three rebounds and Jack Stavens and Axel Fernandez all contributed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern forced Public into 22 turnovers, aided by 13 steals, but that took a ton of effort to produce as the Lancers were running up and down with the Owls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We expended so much energy on defense, when we got to the offensive end, a couple shots were a little short,” said Ray. “You hope a few of those lay-ups might have gone down, a couple threes might have gone down. We fought right to the end though.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was back-and-forth early as Public led by as many as seven midway through the first quarter but Eastern finished the frame with a hoop from Parent and when a steal and Walker lay-up ended the first eight minutes of play, the squads were all tied up at 18-18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Parent 3 only 59 seconds into the second stanza gave Eastern a 21-20 push but off a basket by Andre Timothe, Hartford never trailed again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Midway through the second, Kolano and Parent hit back-to-back hoops to trim the deficit to 29-27 with 2:21 remaining before the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Owls went on a run that lasted into the third frame as a 10-2 jaunt, capped by a 3 from Perry with 3:47 left, put Public on top by a 39-29 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern kept the pressure on defensively and when Walker and Parent added lay-ups and Fernandez found Donohue for a hoop, Eastern was still hanging around - trailing 42-37 through three completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An intentional foul by Kolano to open the fourth started Public on a 6-0 spurt as the team lead 48-37 with 6:53 left to go.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern put together one more run as a 10-5 burst saw Otero score three points, Kolano canned two free throws and when Parent buried a 3 and another jumper, the Lancers were down just 53-47 with 2:46 showing on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still six with 2:15 left but misses began to pile up for Eastern and when Perry canned a 3 and later hit a free throw, it was a double-figure deficit again (59-49).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late Dauphinais hoop ended the scoring for both squads as Eastern absorbed a tough 59-51 defeat to end its season at 3-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Every time we were getting a little closer, they just had us at an arm’s length,” said Ray. “I thought our slow start eventually was going to catch up to us and it did.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…The contest marked the final scholastic game for Eastern seniors Jack Stavens, Trini Otero, Josh Kolano, Tyler Donohue, Axel Fernandez, Trevor Nohilly and co-captains Dylan Woodsome and Elijah Parent.</p>
