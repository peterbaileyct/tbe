<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern baseball team started this week with an unusual back-to-back challenge against Wethersfield on Monday in CCC Interdivisional play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game one took place from home and the Lancers fell behind seven runs early before absorbing a tough 13-7 decision from Clem J. Roy Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield moved to 2-1 overall off the win while Eastern is 0-4 to start the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tuesday’s contest at Esposito Field in Wethersfield is a make-up game from last Friday's postponement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game one of the two game series, the Eagles racked up 15 hits off three Lancer pitchers – taking advantage of 10 base-on-balls along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield starting pitcher Matthew Fletcher threw five scoreless innings to earn the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fletcher did extremely well, striking out seven of the first eleven batters he faced while fanning nine overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He yielded just two singles over a solid effort on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Moore started on the mound for the Lancers and drew the loss, but the chucker hung tough, pitching into the fifth inning, and allowed&nbsp;only four runs (three earned).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Logan Schenck and Mike Roalf also saw action from the mound for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern popped in just six hits for the game, all singles, with Tyler Martin scooping up a third of that offense (two hits, RBI).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield notched two runs in the first and one each in the fourth and fifth frames to make it a 4-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then after the Eagles put&nbsp;a&nbsp;three-spot on the board in the sixth, it was a 7-0 game, and the visitors were firmly in charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern plated two runs in the sixth but Wethersfield scored six times in the top of the seventh that extended the visitors edge to 13-2 with just a half-inning remaining in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers plastered the Eagles for five runs in the bottom of the seventh, highlighted by RBI singles from Ben D’Amato and Martin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Eastern fell 13-7 with another game against Wethersfield looming.</p>
