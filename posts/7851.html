<p>BURLINGTON - In the opener for the Bristol Eastern boys soccer team on Thursday, it was just a 1-1 game with about ten minutes to go in the first half as the Lancers and Lewis Mills were engaged in a nip-and-tuck affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Mills took the edge for good soon after as the Spartans racked up a 4-2 win from Nassahegan Field in Burlington in a CCC South, Patriot Division clash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first match of the season for both programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We moved the ball well at times and got two nice goals, but defensively we had too many breakdowns," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seniors Luke Bushka and Ryan Begert each tallied a goal for the winners while the sophomore duo of Charlie Joiner and Aleks Swider also notched goals to stave off the Eastern aggression.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers drew first blood as Ty Borry fed Dominik Femiak on the left side of the Lewis Mills net, scoring just 3:15 into the game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Mills responded at the 10:50 mark of the first half as Aleksander Swider hit a solid shot from the top of the Eastern goal area, into the near corner, to knot things up at 1-1.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charlie Joiner gave Mills the lead for good with five minutes to play before halftime, scoring off a scramble in front of the Eastern net to make it a 2-1 game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading by a goal, Mills opened the second half with a score when Shane Evans dropped in a shot to make it 3-1 just ninety seconds off the halftime restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trimmed the deficit to 3-2 with 27 minutes remaining in regulation when Eddie Ansah took a Femiak pass and slipped the ball inside the near post.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And quickly, it was a one-goal contest against.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But soon after, the Spartans added an insurance tally as Swider hit a ball out of a crowd that fell into the back of the Eastern net - eventually propelling the home team to a 4-2 triumph.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eastern keeper Carlos Portillo scooped in six saves as did Mills goalie Ryan Mayes.</p>

<p><strong>Up Next for Eastern</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two matches are on the Lancers’ slate next week.</p>
