<p>The monthly City Council meeting tonight will feature a “State of the City” year in review segment as part of the agenda, Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu announced Monday. </p>

<p>“The last year has been a challenging one,” she said. “We don’t typically do an&nbsp;annual review, but we all think it is warranted this year. The City Council members have all had areas of focus during the pandemic so they will reflect on those.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the State of the City, the Police Department will also be swearing in the Deputy Chiefs to their new rank. The city ordinance was recently changed to make for a title change to rename&nbsp;the two Captains as Deputy Chiefs to better reflect the leadership structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Salary Committee will put forward the second piece of the reorganization of the Treasurer and Comptroller offices. </p>

<p>There will be a city-wide COVID update.</p>

<p>There will also be a discussion as to how to amend the Senior Volunteer Tax Credit since most seniors did not have an opportunity to volunteer the necessary hours to be eligible to receive the credit. </p>
