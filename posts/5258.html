<p>BRISTOL - After a few close games to start the campaign, the Bristol Eastern softball team was due for a good old fashion blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters have been putting in the work over its first four games and against Middletown on Wednesday in a CCC South confrontation, it was time to get to the pay window – and collect in a big way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers dropped the Blue Dragons by a 14-0 final from the BE softball field on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crooked numbers were the theme of the day for Eastern (3-2) as the home team put runs on the board in all but the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I like the improvements [at the plate with fewer] strikeouts,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “It’s the first time we haven’t struck out ten or more times in a game. That was good to see. We put the ball in play, making Middletown make plays. We hit a few balls here and there hard. I would have liked to see it a little more consistently throughout the line-up but we took advantage when they gave us extra outs. We took advantage of some good base-running plays. So overall, I’m happy on that side of the ball.“</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol generated two runs in the bottom of the first off only one hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Policki reached on a fielder’s choice and scored when Jasmine Perez’s grounder was thrown away at first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perez nabbed second on the error, went to third on a wild pitch and scored via a passed ball to make it a 2-0 game through one completed frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown’s Cheyenne Fuoco (2-for-3) led off the second by scorching a single to the gap in left but Eastern pitcher Ali Tellier (two hits, 13 K’s) wasn’t bothered in the least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She fanned the side, leaving Fuoco stuck at first base, as Eastern took its 2-0 edge into the bottom of the second – about to break open the bank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Shorette started the second with a single and quickly swiped second to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Ashley Serafin unleashed a double to right as Shorette easily scored and Eastern led 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out, Tellier nearly took a ball out of the park in center but the ball came just short of the fence and was dropped by the fielder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin hustled home to score a run and when Policki beat out an infield hit, Tellier scored from third to make it a 5-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jasmine Perez added a single and when Riley Giblin was hit-by-pitch, the bases were juiced with just one gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Browne (double, two RBI) then lofted a ball to left for an out and Policki tagged the dish as the sacrifice fly made it 6-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with two runners in scoring position, Janessa Gonzalez (2-for-4, four RBI), playing extremely well behind the plate, unleashed a single down the third base line – clearing the bases – as the Lancers snared an imposing 8-0 push as the home team had batted around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third, the Blue Dragons put a runner in scoring position but Tellier generated her seventh strikeout of the game to end the threat as the visitors were on the wrong side of an 8-0 score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That was a good confidence booster for her. She pitched well,” said Redman of Tellier. “She was commanding almost everything most of the game. And when we had a pretty good lead, she was still kind of locked in. I thought she was throwing harder at the end of the game than she was in the beginning.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s pretty impressive given the score. She stayed locked in and kept the shutout intact which was good.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin drew a leadoff walk in the bottom of the third but did not score while in Middletown’s fourth frame, the visiting aggression attempted to get into the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fuoco dropped in a one-out infield hit but ended up stuck at second base at the completion of the half-inning as Eastern was about to make it a double-digit affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two runners on, Browne slipped an RBI double into center and Gonzalez followed up with a two-base hit of her own – plating Giblin and Browne – to make it an 11-0 game as Eastern was in complete control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern loaded the bases without the benefit of an out in the fifth and when Giblin was plunked by a pitch – this time in the top of the helmet – pinch runner Sophia Nocera scored as the game was a 12-0 romp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Lacouture then dropped in an infield hit to second as the fielder didn’t have a play anywhere as the RBI tally helped Eastern go into the sixth stanza ahead by 13 runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons failed to score in the sixth as the 13-0 lead holding firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back-to-back-to-back singles by Tellier, Policki and Perez netted the Lancers a run in the sixth as the home team brought a 14-0 cushion into the seventh and final frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier ended the contest by generating strikeout number 12 and 13 as the Lancers defeated the Blue Dragons, 14-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Monday [against Lewis Mills], I think the girls expected this type of game,” said Redman. “I told them, it was a different approach from them today. Monday, they went in lackadaisical. Today, they came in focused. They scored early and they kept scoring a little bit here, a little bit there. I would have liked to have ended it a little bit earlier but it was fine.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They didn’t show up the other team. They played with some class and we kept trying to attack at the plate.”</p>
