<p>BRISTOL – Never count out the Bristol Eastern boys soccer program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after two one-goal losses, the Lancers finally got back to the pay window on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored a goal in each of the first and second periods to stave off Plainville, netting an impressive 2-1 victory from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers improved to 3-9-1 overall while the Blue Devils fell to 7-6 – breaking a two-match winning streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern got on the scoreboard with 1:48 left in the first half as Dom Femiak converted a Cody Greger to Adam Borry combination, leading to a through ball that Femiak controlled and hit into the right near inside of the Plainville net for a goal.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern the doubled the Plainville deficit about five minutes into the second half as Eddie Ansah took in a Rocco Barbino pass, beating two defenders down the right side of the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah then turned the corner and sent a pass into the Blue Devils’ goal area where Adam Borry drilled a hard shot by Plainville Keeper Joshua Elliotte as Eastern’s 2-0 lead would be too much for the visiting aggression to handle.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Trevor Rau scored a goal, chopping the deficit in half with 3:07 to go but the Kingstreeters ran out the clock – moving the ball down Plainville's flanks – and never let the Blue Devils notch a game-tying score to seal the victory.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Dylan Piazza led our backs, Connor Cyr, Preston Guarda, and Carter Harris, in a coordinated effort that stymied the dangerous Plainville attack," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp;"Our midfielders, Ty Borry, Andre Gonzalez, and Donyell Maxwell, supported the backs and linked well with our attackers."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern keeper Carlos Portillo made eight saves as did Elliotte from Plainville.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Eastern has three tough matches left this season with the final two coming from home at Alumni Field in Bristol…The Lancers travel to Glastonbury on Monday for a 3:45 p.m. contest as the squad has not lost over its last four matches (3-0-1)…Eastern ends its regular season with contests against Wethersfield (October 28, 6 p.m.) and Bristol Central (November 2, 7 p.m.) in a boys/girls city series double-dip…The win against the Blue Devils was the first victory for the Lancers since roping up 4-0 win over Platt in Meriden back on September 24 (on the CIAC website, it says Eastern defeated Platt 54-0 that day. That would have been something to see…).</p>
