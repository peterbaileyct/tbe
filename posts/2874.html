<p>This TBE special podcast features a discussion between David Fortier and Lindsay Vigue, chair of the City Arts and Culture Commission, which recently oversaw a major project, bringing a mural downtown.</p>

<p>Elements in the mural connect to Bristol's history. One more oblique item, the clock is set at 8:17, contains a bit of mystery.</p>

<p>In fact, Vigue issues a challenge during the podcast: anyone who knows what that time refers to should email dfortier@bristoledition.org with an answer. Once she confirms it is the correct answer, TBE will post it.</p>

<p>The mural is the work of West Hartford's <a href="https://coreypane.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coreypane.com/">Corey Pane</a>, who has garnered attention for his work designing cleats for pro football players, such as wide receiver Antonio Brown and defensive back Xavier Rhodes. </p>
