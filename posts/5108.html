<p>FARMINGTON – The Bristol Eastern boys tennis team finally got back on the court on Tuesday, April 13 as the Lancers opened their 2020-21 campaign against a very talented Farmington team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The River Hawks haven’t lost a regular season match since the May 18, 2019 and that trend continued against Eastern in a CCC Interdivisional match from the Farmington high school tennis courts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals battled but Farmington ended up snaring a 6-1 victory in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were swept in doubles action and dropped three of the four singles’ matches but each competitor from Eastern showed a little something on the court that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Overall, I thought we played very well in our opening match against a very historically strong opponent,” said Eastern tennis coach Logan Brooke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s lone victory came at the No. 3 singles position as junior Nathaniel Lund defeated Roshan Krishnan in straight sets (6-2, 6-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top singles match, Eastern senior Brandon Greger fell to Farmington’s Jerry Zhang (6-0, 6-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the No. 2 slot, the Lancers’ Andrew Anulewicz, a very good senior, made Farmington’s Vedanish Patel work for his victory (6-4, 6-4) while the No. 4 singles bout saw Camden Michaud fall to the River Hawks’ Karthik Pyneni (6-1, 6-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In No. 1 doubles action, Farmington’s Abhishek Mannom and Ricky Duan defeated Eastern’s Nolan Abitabilo and Nathaniel Woodford (6-1, 6-0) but in the second doubles spot, the Lancers gave the River Hawks a real run for their money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Joseph Verardi and Luke Hammer gave the team of Aditya Kumarappon and Gautham Santhanam all it could handle but the Farmington duo pulled out a tough 6-4, 7-5 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in No. 3 doubles, Farmington’s Tom Kot and Richard Jiang beat Thomas Beaulieu and Christopher Brown by scores of 6-0, 6-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern’s boys team is home for its next three matches, starting with a non-conference showdown against Windsor Locks on Thursday at 3:45 p.m. from the tennis courts on the campus of Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then next Monday, the Lancers host Rocky Hill while the following day, the boys squad from New Britain comes to Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both those matches commence at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking a little further down the road, Eastern tangles with Bristol Central this season on Friday, May 21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That match takes place from the tennis courts at Bristol Central.</p>
