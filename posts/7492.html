<p> The long-anticipated event was supposed to begin at 4:30 p.m., and not a soul was in sight. The disappointed cub reporter headed for his car to return home without a story.</p>

<p>But then, in the distance, a solo intrepid canine approached warily. “Are you here for the Pooch Plunge today?” I asked him, but he just looked away in silence. His owner informed me that his name was Summit and they were bringing him to Rockwell so he could swim and socialize with other dogs.</p>

<p>Soon after, a second dog arrives. Her name is Molly, and she is very friendly. As it turns out, Molly is more of a social butterfly than a swimmer. She greets every new arrival at the entrance, tail wagging and sniffing up a storm. Back in my school days a long time ago, Molly would have been called a brown-nose, literally. She is looking to make friends with everyone who arrives.</p>

<p>As time passes more pooches filter in, about a dozen all together by 5 p.m. (For recent high school graduates who were taught Modern Math, a dozen equals 12.)</p>

<p>The lifeguards on duty tell me it is a much smaller crowd than usual, and I am sure the weather is the biggest factor. Why go swimming when you can get drenched stepping off your porch?</p>

<p>The dog owners stand anxiously on the edge of the pool, watching their loved ones plod through the water. The dogs all seem to be copying the only swim stroke I ever mastered, the _____something _____ paddle. I can’t remember the first word of the title, but it was a very common swim stroke for the younger crowd in my day.</p>

<p> All in all, it appears the 10th annual Pooch Plunge is a success. The turnout is hampered by the weather, but the enjoyment of the participants is real.</p>

<p>For those of you concerned about health codes, the pool will be drained for the season tomorrow morning. But every dog here has had their day.</p>
