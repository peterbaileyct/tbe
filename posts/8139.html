<p>The Mum Festival,&nbsp;which&nbsp;has been&nbsp;Bristol’s&nbsp;fall marquee community-focused&nbsp;event for&nbsp;almost 60&nbsp;years,&nbsp;is back&nbsp;this&nbsp;weekend (September&nbsp;24<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;–&nbsp;26<sup>th</sup>)&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;move&nbsp;to Downtown Bristol&nbsp;and a theme of&nbsp;“Honoring Heroes.”</p>

<p>This year’s Festival will run from September 24<sup>th</sup> – 26<sup>th</sup> and will feature vendors from area businesses, crafters, local producers, restaurants, food trucks, community organizations, non- profits, and museums, as well as the popular Mum Festival Parade. In addition, the Festival will feature children’s programming, a classic car show, an art show, great food, a beer, and wine garden, plenty of live music and entertainment and more.</p>

<p>“The annual Bristol Mum Festival is this weekend’s best music and entertainment destination”, said Maria Salice, Bristol Mum Festival Entertainment Chair. “Our live musical entertainment lineup will once again appeal to just about every taste in music. The Mum Festival has become somewhat of a mini music festival featuring a variety of top-notch entertainment of all genres of music. This year promises to be no different”.</p>

<p>This year’s Festival&nbsp;which&nbsp;has moved&nbsp;to Downtown Bristol will&nbsp;also&nbsp;feature&nbsp;plenty of children’s entertainment at the annual Kids Zone&nbsp;and a special event for art lovers.</p>
