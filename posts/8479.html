<p>BRISTOL - The streak continues for the Bristol Eastern volleyball squad over its crosstown rival, Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After last Monday’s 3-1 triumph over the Rams, the Lancers have defeated the Rams in 54 straight matches - a tally that seems extraordinary just in its presentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the players who continued the streak were born long after 1994 - the last time Central defeated Eastern on the court - and are carrying on a legacy that is now generational in scope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, is that streak a big deal to the members of the outfit from King Street? Or are these showdowns, and victories against Central, just another stop along a grueling regular season of play?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the most recent match against Central, TBE caught up with Eastern senior Alex Shorette - a versatile senior that can play multiple positions on the floor - has seen her squad defeat the Rams seven times as the member of the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had some insightful thoughts about the recent win over Central, Eastern’s offensive attack and the streak the Lancers are enjoying over the Rams:</p>

<p><strong>Michael Letendre, TBE:</strong> “The Bristol Eastern volleyball team could have allowed Central to win another set (or two) after the Rams won the first game in your showdown last Monday but you and your teammates really shut the match down over those final three sets…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Alex Shorette</strong>: “We work well together as a team and we communicate well. We really wanted this game and fought for it. I mean we all played well all the way around. We all worked together, we all talked, all the players contributed in a positive way and I think that’s what really helped us. We all stayed mentally strong as well and I think that’s a really great aspect [of this win].”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Letendre</strong>: “Tell me what happens when the Eastern offense gets set up properly for a big swing or a kill out there on the floor.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shorette</strong>: “We do it in a smart way. We know Hannah [Webber] is a power-hitter so if we need a strong hitter, the ball goes to Hannah or Lauren [Bender]. If we need smart plays, it could go anywhere. I mean, we’re all really great hitters and the ball can go anywhere possible. I think when we run our offense, our setter [Abby Jones] has full confidence in each and every one of us. The ball can just go anywhere, honestly.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Letendre</strong>: “This winning streak against Bristol Central, is that something you’re thinking about? Is that something in your head when you are about to play the Rams?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shorette</strong>: “It is an aspect, yes. But for us, it’s another game. It goes towards our record. It goes towards us getting into the playoffs and the CCC [Tournament]. It is an important game. It’s a huge mental game but it’s our streak and we’re just going to keep going with it. For us right now, it was a game that we needed to get and we did it. That’s all that matters. We won the game. It’s just another score on our tally. We’ll just keep going.”</p>
