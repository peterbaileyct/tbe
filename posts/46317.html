 A crowd gathers in the rain around the pavilion on Memorial Boulevard for a Memorial Day ceremony that included the reading of the names of all those from Bristol who have lost their lives in American wars and conflicts. The ceremony was followed by the dedication of the new POW/MIA monument across the boulevard. | David Fortier
