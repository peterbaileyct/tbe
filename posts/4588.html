<p>The Bristol Central boys basketball team looks to remain undefeated on Tuesday as the program travels to New Britain for a huge CCC Region B tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain was rolling right along this season before being derailed by Farmington (47-39) last Friday which doesn’t say much because after Central, there’s a ton of parity in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams haven’t played in about a week because of the weather and are itching to get back on the court against the Golden Hurricanes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the biggest road game of the season for Central on the horizon, here’s a quick look at what to expect tonight in New Britain<strong>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central (3-0) at New Britain (2-2)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time –&nbsp;</strong>6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> – from the New Britain High School gymnasium</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The question –&nbsp;</strong>How do you stop a 7-foot giant from scoring 30-plus points against your team?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Donovan Clingan is averaging 32.0 points and 14.3 rebounds-per-game this year and New Britain, like every other squad in Region B play, is not equipped to handle the junior center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What kind of junk (or gimmick) defense can you play against the Rams to slow the big man down?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or is it better to stop the rest Central’s cast of characters, starring the likes of Damion Glasper, Sean Wininger, and&nbsp;Carson Rivoira, and just let Clingan get his usual offense?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the Shaquille O’Neal defensive question. And ‘hack-a-Clingan’ can backfire very quickly when the big man has his stroke at the charity stripe going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, neither option is a good one because Glasper (12.7 points-per-game) is a streaky shooter who can heat up quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He currently leads the Rams in three-pointers made with six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger has popped three 3s this season, is averaging just under nine points-a-game and extremely capable of a double-double against the Golden Hurricanes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it looks like Rivoira (6.3 points-per-game) is just scratching the surface when it comes to putting his complete package together on the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is an underrated defender and his scoring is starting to tick up this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Victor Rosa and D’Ante Ross are just getting their basketball legs back and if those weapons can produce, the Golden Hurricanes are in for a long night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For New Britain, junior guard Justice Carter was averaging 14.5 points over his first two games and is a legit scoring threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore guard Tyrone Cummings can also put the ball in the hoop and is very athletic like the rest of the team in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the squad is on a two-game losing skid and Central could make it three straight at the completion of thirty-two minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has the makings of a fun game as New Britain is always a challenging place to play and compete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a few early slam dunks by Clingan should give the visitors an early lead that will be tough to come back from in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the first of three games this week for the Bristol Central program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Just in – </strong>Bristol Central is tied for sixth place in the current GameTimeCT Top 10 basketball Poll. The Rams and Ridgefield are both 3-0 and trail just East Catholic, Windsor, Northwest Catholic (all CCC teams), Notre Dame-West Haven and Sacred Heart of the Naugatuck Valley League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games on the horizon:&nbsp;</strong>Lewis Mills at Bristol Central (Friday, February 26, 6:45 p.m.); Bristol Central at Plainville (Saturday, February 27, 3 p.m.).</p>
