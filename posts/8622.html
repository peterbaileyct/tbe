<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol City Series cross country race made a triumphant return in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>COVID might have knocked out the 2020 contest but it was back - and better than ever - in 2021 at the hilly course at Page Park this past Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all, nearly seventy competitors took to the course for both the boys and girls races with Central’s Frankie Porrini (18:21) winning for the boys and St. Paul Catholic’s Madalyne Bielecki (23:53) taking the event for the girls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only thing different at Page was the newly revamped finish line, a bit remodeled due to the pool project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the hills and winding trails were back, to no one’s pleasure, but the boys and girls from Bristol Central, Bristol Eastern, and St. Paul Catholic truly could care less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the teams were elated to be back together again, running and competing under the three scholastic banners in town.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s great to be back and have all the team’s back together again,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “We really missed this last year."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>‘Weird course’</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After winning the 2021 city series cross country individual title, Porrini called Page Park a ‘weird course.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But was Porrini correct in that assessment?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re known for hills in Bristol and the course over at Rockwell Park isn’t devoid of treacherous spots, hazards and tight spaces either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fuller designed the course at Page Park and knows it’s not your run-of-the-mill scholastic venue for cross country events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The thing with this course is you’re either descending or you’re climbing,” said Fuller. “We think there’s only three-hundred to four-hundred meters of flat [course]. It’s one of the worst courses to run because there’s no time to catch your breath.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And is it any fun to sprint down the hill in front of the Page Park pool just to have to run up the other side of it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or to sprint on pavement for just thirty-seconds or so before hitting the woods across from the ski lodge…just to start running uphill again?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Weird is a good term by Porrini but crazy might be in the mix as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If you’re climbing a hill, great, and then all of a sudden, you’re descending,” said Fuller. “So the lactic acid is building up. The times are obviously slower than you’re going to see at [the state meets] from Wickham [Park] or Avon. Everyone wants to go to Avon from last year because it’s flat. There aren’t any hills whatsoever.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s plenty of excitement left for our cross country teams in town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of the Central Connecticut Conference, the league championships take place this coming Tuesday at 3 p.m. from Wickham Park in Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a week after that, on October 26, the CCC Freshman Championships - always an exciting race - commences at 4 p.m. from the West Hartford Reservoir.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday, October 30 is the day of the Class L championships - also from Wickham Park - and the State Open commences on Friday, November 5 over a busy finish of the scholastic season.</p>
