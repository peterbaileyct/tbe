<p>The Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern volleyball city series battles went on for quite sometime, starting in 1997, with the Lancers usually capturing victory over three straight sets - rarely having to play a fourth (or fifth) game against the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s all part of a 53-match winning streak that Eastern currently enjoys over Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams managed to stave off a sweep more than a time or two against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were four-set Central/Eastern matches in 1997, 2000, 2001, and 2002 which included a weird showdown between the teams on October 3, 2001.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 15-6, 0-15, 15-0 and 15-12 in one of the strangest scoring matches in city series history that saw both squads shutout the other during game play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the rematch on October 25, 2001 saw the Lancers shut down the Rams over consecutive sets (15-8, 15-5, and 15-10).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s how things went between the programs for quite sometime with the Lancers dominating and the Rams struggling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With JV coach Linda Evans filling in for Eastern’s Gail Ericson during the 2002 campaign, those scores never changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers zipped up a 3-1 win over the Rams on October 2 (15-11, 15-10, 11-15, and 15-7) and then swept Central (15-6, 15-3, and 15-6) in the rematch on October 25.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2003, scholastic volleyball changed to a 25-point scoring format but in terms of BC/BE volleyball entanglements, it was the same, predictable results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, October 6, Ericson roped up her 300th career victory in Eastern’s 3-0 blanking of Central (25-12, 25-4, and 25-7).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stef Aboagye dropped in nine kills while Kate Brunet added five for the Lancers on the historic evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s second victory against Central came on October 28, 2004 in a 3-0 sweep over the Rams (25-14, 25-10, and 25-14), propelling the squad to a share of the CCC South title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brunet roped up 11 kills, Aboagye added eight while Taylor Losey - another future All-Stater - dropped in six kills to lead the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central showed some gumption in 2005 - the season Eastern swept Masuk (25-13, 25-10, and 25-16) to seize its first Class L title since 1991.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams pushed Eastern to four sets in both matches but Central fell on October 5 (25-4, 25-11, 20-25, and 25-11) and then twenty-one days later, it was a clean sweep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern then went back to the Class L title game - closing out Central in consecutive 3-0 contests along the way - in 2006 as the Lancers swept East Lyme, 3-0 (25-12, 25-19, and 25-16) for another championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2007, the Lancers were finally defeated in the Class L title bout - dropping a 3-0 decision to Darien, a squad that ran off three consecutive&nbsp; titles, but Eastern (23-2) added two more Central sweeps to its till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact during one stretch during city series encounters, over 21 of 23 straight matches, Central fell to Eastern over consecutive sets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the Rams had to tangle with the likes of Karissa Smith and Brianna Root - more All-State talent - and those Central showdowns continued to go 3-0 into the decade of 2010 but Jen Manzo’s crew from the school on the hill was certainly much improved.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On October 29, 2010, Central pushed Eastern to a fourth set but behind 15 kills from Smith, the Lancers were 25-14, 23-25, 25-13, and 25-18 winners in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern snuck in another title run during those years, capturing the 2012 Class L championship in a neat 3-0 sweep of East Lyme (25-14, 25-18, and 25-21) as head coach Stacy Rivoira (Mills) won her second title at BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fast forwarding to October 27, 2015, Central battled Eastern to another four-set war but Angela Daley and Bailey Wyrebek were too tough for the Rams’ squad to overcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it took what seemed an eternity for the next five-set match between the squads but in 2017, the Rams and Lancers engaged in one heck of a battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern defeated Central, three-games-to-two, on October 26.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 20-25, 25-22, 22-25, 25-20, and 15-10 in a back-and-forth tilt from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman Zoe Lowe tallied 16 kills and 12 digs while Ali Rivoira dished out 35 assists for Eastern over the winning match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Brianna Saverino nabbed 16 kills for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Monday, November 6, No. 18 Eastern had to open state tournament play at No. 15 Central in Class L action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was another one of those rare instances where Central (13-7 regular season) had a better record than Eastern (12-7) but the ultimate result was still the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers dropped the Rams (25-10, 26-24, and 25-12) for a three-match tournament sweep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2018, Eastern claimed two additional victories over 3-0 and 3-1 scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over the last two seasons, Central won six sets and saw two matches go the distance against Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The battle on October 8, 2019 went all five sets and had a couple wild games as Central coach Lance Pepper and Eastern mentor Stefanie Reay saw its squads leave it all on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 30-32, 27-25, 25-19, 23-25, and 15-13 in a match that had 14 lead changes and 35 ties but Eastern came away a 3-2 victor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kat Ross led Central with 11 kills while Lowe dropped in a match-high 21 kills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then finally on October 29 of this past year, Central had its best chance of knocking off Eastern since 1994.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an epic battle, seeing the Rams zip up a 2-1 lead before dropping the fourth and fifth sets in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern won 25-22, 27-29, 23-25, 25-18, and 15-10 to complete the regular season at a perfect 11-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lowe ended her final regular season match with 19 kills and 19 digs while Emily Ericson collected 15 kills and 10 digs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory for Eastern gave the program its 53rd straight win over Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been such a one-sided series in Bristol, the only real suspense left could come during the fall of 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will the Lancers, due to graduate several veteran players, extend their streak over Central or will the Rams embark on a different quest that includes a victory (or two) against the Lancers?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next October should be a very interesting month when the programs hit the court for the annual city series battle.</p>
