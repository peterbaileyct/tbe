<p>In a half-hour conversation, City Arts and Culture Commission chair Lindsay Vigue and I discuss the year-old arts commission, its goals for the city, some of its accomplishments and upcoming events.</p>

<p>During the conversation, Lindsay shares her experiences--she loves to travel--and, at one point, she pauses while a helicopter passes over head. She is phoning in from the rooftop of the building where her photography studio is located, on one of the brightest days in this cool rainy springtime.</p>

<p>Except for a few sound adjustments, the audio is unedited. In some places, Lindsay's voice drops away, but I think we lucked out overall because most of the conversation is easily accessible.<br></p>
