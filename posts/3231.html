<p>At the same time, 168 people have registered and voted at city hall, making use of Election Day Registration, said Democratic Deputy Registrar Tracy Beland in a text update.</p>

<p>In-person voting continues at a steady pace, with 38.7 percent of eligible voters making it to one of Bristol's nine polling places.</p>

<p>Beginning the day, Bristol had 37,196 eligible voters. Of these, 9,838 returned absentee ballots, and 14, 413 have voted in person. Together, and again, unofficially, 65 percent of eligible voters have cast ballots.</p>

<p>Prospective voters can still register at city hall if they have moved from another town or state or never voted, Beland texted. They will need a valid photo ID and proof of residency, including a bank statement or utility bill but not including an Amazon receipt.</p>
