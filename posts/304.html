The Bristol Edition is getting ready to reenter the news publishing arena. I think arena is a good word for what is happening these days in journalism. With that in mind, I am asking anyone who is interested in joining me to read on and, if interested, to leave a comment with contact information.

Before doing so, please consider the following:

TBE is part of my masters project. It is beginning because I see a need for a new community-based journalism and I would like to find out whether it is possible to create and sustain such a venture, so that it might root itself in our city and grow, but also to record the steps we take so that they might be replicated in other places, even schools.

The way I see, and I am not alone in this, a gaping hole exists in cities like ours for news. If we, as citizens wait for the market to fill the gap, well, we already see what happens--a lot of nothing worth talking about. That leaves it up to us, as citizens, to produce an online newspaper of our own, i.e., a publication of Bristol citizens, by Bristol citizens, for Bristol citizens. There is enough homegrown talent for us to do this together. Not everyone has to be on board, but such an endeavor requires a critical mass of committed individuals to get this done, to provide this service for Bristol.

My role will be to provide guidance and instruction for anyone who meets the qualifications, listed below, for anyone who is willing to engage in conversations about what community journalism is and how  citizens come together to make it happen. Not everyone has to have the skills to do this. People will be trained. In this instance, because it is a volunteer effort, the project cries out for that critical mass of well-meaning people to get on board. At the same time, I will be documenting the process as part of my course work.

Regarding the news, TBE will be going after information, based on facts, in a highly disciplined manner. Our editorial and opinion pages will focus on the same approach, encouraging examination of facts and information to bolster arguments and positions, so that our readers get information upon to make informed decisions.

The goal is to foster a highly ethical approach to reporting and an equally dynamic approach to our commentary pages. Our first loyalty is to the truth, followed closely by loyalty to our readers.

With that in mind, here are some considerations:
<ol>
 	<li>Are you a Bristol person? This is key. You must have some connection to Bristol, but being a resident is key.</li>
 	<li>This is a volunteer endeavor. Are you willing to spend some time learning about journalism?</li>
 	<li>You may write or photograph or video or design webpages, great. But if you don't and would like to learn, this is a great opportunity. Share your level of skill and of interest in a specific role.</li>
 	<li>Maybe you are not a writer or photographer or videographer or website page designer but you consider yourself an expert in some field, either through education, work, life experience or life-long interest. In other words, you consider yourself an expert, someone who can be an impartial and objective judge of merit, in any of these areas, ethics, journalism, government, art, sports, education. budgeting, history, science, finance, and on and on. And you would not mind having our reporters consult you on an as need basis?</li>
 	<li>Maybe you do not want to write or act as an expert. Perhaps, you have other skills to offer, say, as a website guru, ethicist or management specialist. Add yourself to list of experts.</li>
 	<li>Maybe I have missed something. Tell me more about it.</li>
</ol>
There are as many ways to help as there are committed individuals interesting in joining this project.

If you think you would like to get involved, please leave a comment on this page, with the following information:
<ol>
 	<li>Name and email</li>
 	<li>Area of interest</li>
 	<li>Area of expertise--this can be writing, photography/videography, design, or in a specific knowledge field from ethics to science and the arts or budgeting.</li>
 	<li>Willingness to attend classes on journalism</li>
 	<li>What do you see as your role, at least in the beginning: active participant or on the sidelines as an expert contact?</li>
</ol>
I will get back to you as soon as possible.
