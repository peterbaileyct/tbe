<p>BRISTOL – The senior American Legion baseball team from Bristol opened its 2021 campaign against West Hartford on Thursday as two talented squads attempted to earn their first victory of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol held the initial lead, saw Post 96 seize a 3-1 advantage midway through the contest before Post 2 tied things up going into the final inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But West Hartford had all the answers late as an error, a base hit, a sacrifice bunt and finally the game-winning single from Tom Redden propelled Post 96 to a 4-3 victory in Zone 1 action from Hall High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I told them I was disappointed with the outcome but happy with the fight,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “Down 3-1, we could have gone away there but we got back in the game and had a couple chances to take the lead. We just didn’t get a hit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford scored its first three runs via two, two out rallies, and when the pressure was on, Post 96 added numbers to the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the final play was a bang-bang hit to third base as the tally was going to jam up Bristol third baseman Zach Rinavage - whether he fielded it or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The ball hit the line,” said LaPenta of the game-winning hit by Redden. “Zach thought he maybe could have gotten it but he said if he caught it, the guy was going to score but [Zach] didn’t know the [runner] was going back to the bag. If he caught it, he probably didn’t have a play and the bases would have been loaded with one out. We’re still in a tough spot.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 made an excellent showing as losing pitcher Albert Molina showed grit, made big pitches and kept his squad in the game late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lefty allowed just five hits, walked one and fanned a couple over his six-plus innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He threw well,” said LaPenta of Molina.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had an eventful first inning - tallying a run on the scoreboard to snare the early edge in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Brown (2-for-4, two runs scored) led off with a single while Adam Caron (2-for-4) dropped a one-hopper to center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with men on the corners and one out, Zack Rinavage sent a ball to centerfield on off the catch, Brown charged home as the sacrifice fly gave Post 2 a 1-0 lead through just a half inning of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford struck right back as leadoff hitter Alex Ciafone fell behind 0-2 but managed to draw a walk and later stole second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He advanced to third on a groundout and when Drew Seidman slipped a flare into left-centerfield, Ciafone tagged the dish to knot the score at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams were retired in order in the second stanza as Molina got into a bit of a groove - as did West Hartford pitcher Joseph Dooley - but Bristol’s Nate Ouellette dropped a base hit into center with one out in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Brown lined out to short and Ouellette got doubled up to end the Bristol third as the game remained a 1-1 stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molina had retired six straight before yielding a two-out single to Redden (2-for-4) in the bottom of the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Seidman popped out to Caron at first, making a bit of a diving play to end the inning with the game still tied at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tough fourth frame for Post 2 as Caron wrangled up his second single of the game and when Evan Bouchard walked, two were on with no one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a second straight inning-ending double play put West Hartford back at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96 finally took the lead in the bottom of the fourth as Tom LaSpada opened the inning with a single to right but two outs later, he was still stuck on first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ixael Albino then reached via error and when Lankevin cleared the bases with a deep double to left, the only extra-base hit of the showdown, it was a 3-1 game through four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fifth, Bristol’s Matt Beaucar drew a one-out single to left as Post 2 was on the move again, but the visitors did not score as West Hartford continued to lead by two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the top of sixth, Bristol struck pay dirt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown led off with a single to right and when Caron’s grounder to shortstop was misplayed, two men were on with no outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone, Rinavage’s grounder to second was misplayed as Brown scored from third to chop the deficit to 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Jack Kozikowski grounded to second, the ball was thrown home but Caron easily scored and on the RBI fielder’s choice, the score was knotted at 3-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol then had men on the corners and with two outs, the locals attempted its vaunted ‘Bristol pickle’ - with Kozikowksi at first base running to second, stalling midway in hoping to bait a throw as Rinavage was looking to score the go-ahead run from third base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But West Hartford did not bite, eventually got out of the frame, but Post 2 had the event tied up at 3-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dooley started the bottom of the sixth with a single and was lifted for a pinch runner who was immediately picked off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rest of the line-up was retired in order as the score was still 3-3 going into the final inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Alex Canzellarini led off with a walk, eventually stealing second to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Caron drilled a hard shot right at the second baseman as Post 96 got out of the stanza with the bottom of the seventh looming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had the go-ahead run at second base and Adam had a great at-bat,” said LaPenta. “He hit the ball as hard as you can hit it and it’s all I can ask. It just happened to be at somebody.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lankevin started the rally with a shot to left-center that was misplayed as the wind just seemed to carry the ball in the wrong direction as a catch wasn’t made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The wind-ball started the bottom of the seventh,” said LaPenta. “It’s a tough play this time of night. At first, I thought it was an easy out but it stayed up there an awful long time. That kind of put us in an eight-ball spot there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the top of the order coming up, Molina was lifted for Canzellarini.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ciafone singled and Weiss bunted the duo over as men were on second and third with one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Redden unleashed his hit that just bounced down the third base line in fair territory as the winning run scored and Post 2 absorbed a tough 4-3 loss in its Zone 1 opener.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I knew looking at the zone we’ll be fighting with West Hartford and a couple other clubs for the zone” title said LaPenta. “But it’s all about how you’re playing at the end of the year. I was happy with the effort [and] I think we have a good club. We have an exhibition game [on Friday] to get our first ‘W’ and get rolling from there.”&nbsp;</p>
