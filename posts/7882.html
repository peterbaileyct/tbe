<p>SIMSBURY - After last year’s cancellation, the 40th Stratton Brook Cross Country Invite from Simsbury went off without a hitch as the boys and girls squads from Bristol Central took part of the event.</p>

<p>In the large school boys varsity race, the outfit from BC did a very good job at the competition according to long time Bristol Central cross country coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk.</p>

<p>“[The] boys placed 11th” overall said Stafford-Kirk. “Junior Frankie Porrini was sixth and junior Chris Roy placed 19th to lead us.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini finished in 17:37 which was just nine seconds off the time of the fourth place competitor.</p>

<p>Roy was also in the mix until the end, running extremely well.</p>

<p>Also performing well for the Rams was Ryan Sarmiento (59th, 20:49), Tyler Wilson (69th, 22:10) and Scott Petrosky (73rd, 22:42).</p>

<p>The girls from Central also saw action that day, performing in JV competition - running in the girls large school challenge.</p>

<p>Maura Waters was the top finisher for the girls group from the school from Bristol.</p>

<p>“With a young girls team of freshmen and sophomores, we put all the girls in the JV race,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Maura Waters led the girls in 13th place at 25:35 followed by Sophia Stark in 18th (26:16). Katie Tran (30th, 27:22), Janelle Brand(86th, 36:09), and Rachel Griffin (89th, 38:19) rounded out the girls team today.”&nbsp;</p>
