<p>The City of Bristol’s Public Works Department has released its schedule for the 2021 fall paving program which will be completed in two phases. <br></p>

<p>“The initial phase consists of milling off the existing pavement of the road,” said Public Works Director Raymond Rogozinski. “The second phase consists of installing a new roadway surface and will commence shortly after the first phase.  Once construction is complete, the City will repair any affected driveway aprons.”</p>
