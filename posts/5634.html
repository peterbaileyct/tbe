<p>From an outsider’s perspective, most people know Bristol Central senior Sean Wininger as a member of the Central Connecticut Conference boys basketball conference champions in 2021 – helping the program to an undefeated 15-0 ledger and a No. 1 ranking in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that might be a pandemic related thought because Wininger, one of Central’s top baseball pitchers over the last few seasons, and the Rams saw their 2020 spring campaign wiped out due to the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the big man can chuck a baseball with zest and started his senior campaign like the pandemic never took place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s certainly talented, is always improving at the plate, and put himself on the map as collegiate programs took notice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The baseball program at Central Connecticut State University certainly did and the Blue Devils wanted the senior to play for its outstanding team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just last week, Wininger committed to Central Connecticut State University and will suit up for the baseball team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[I’m] excited and grateful to announce my commitment to Central Connecticut State University to further my academic and athletic career,” said Wininger via Twitter. “I want to thank my family, friends, teammates and coaches who have supported me and gotten me to where I am today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger has been a critical component for the Bristol Central squad over the years – hitting the mound as a sophomore for coach Bunty Ray, keeping his spot in the rotation with guts, guile, and ability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a sophomore in 2019, Wininger threw in nine games at Central, starting eight overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 4-4 that season with an ERA of 4.30 with the pitch count knocking him out of games that he could have continued to throw in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger won 40-percent of Central’s games that campaign, allowing just 18 earned runs over 29.33 innings pitched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When he’s not throwing the ball, Wininger can be found in right field as the tri-captain of the squad and has been an invaluable member of the program once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger helped the Rams topple Enfield on May 3, coming out of the bullpen to lead the Rams to a huge 7-6 win in 11 innings on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in his last game, a big 8-4 victory at Middletown on May 12, the chucker helped Central with a slick five-inning, seven strikeout performance that saw the program move to 9-5 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were other games this season where Wininger pitched well enough to earn the victory, such as Central’s 1-0 loss to Berlin back on April 28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just three hits in the losing effort to the Redcoats and then in the first battle against Bristol Eastern on May 6, several errors led to a tough 6-5 loss for the Rams but Wininger was in each game, making big pitches and giving his squad every chance to turn the game around offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s an outstanding young man who should thrive at the university in New Britain whether it’s on the diamond or hitting the books in the classroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, Central Connecticut has put together a very good season – going 24-12 overall as the Northeast Conference Championship tournament commences on May 27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several players from Bristol have suited up for the Blue Devils over the years and Wininger should be a perfect fit for the program.</p>
