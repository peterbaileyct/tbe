<p>“This is not the type of activity we want in any neighborhood and I am happy that the Police were able to identify and remove these two individuals from the street,” said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “On another front, we are also targeting landlords who do not do adequate background checks and allow disruptive activities to occur within their apartments.”<br><br>“We strongly encourage residents and neighbors to communicate with us, their representatives on City Council, as well as to use the COPS Tip Line at 860-585-TIPS to anonymously report any suspicious activities so that it can be investigated,” said Councilwoman Brittany Barney, who represents Federal Hill, where this incident occurred.</p>
