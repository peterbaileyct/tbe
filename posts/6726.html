<p>The Bristol American Legion Baseball squad is currently 14-5 overall as the final week of the season is upon the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals are 11-1 over its last 12 games in Zone 1 play and on Friday, Post 2 belted Naugatuck by a 14-7 from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol took the season series from the program, 2-1, and is 12-4 in Zone 1 play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Lozier went 5.2 innings for Post 2, moving to 3-0 on the campaign - throwing just over 100 pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a season-high in runs for Post 2 while Naugy’s Andrew Tyszka ended up losing the contest for the visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol notched those 14 runs on 13 hits as Post 2 went for five runs in the bottom of the second inning and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after Naugatuck trimmed the deficit to 5-4, Bristol generated three runs in the fourth, fifth, and sixth frames to ice the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck fell to 9-7 off the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the nightcap, Bristol used four different pitchers against non-zone foe Branford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 ended up falling to Branford by an 8-1 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Canzellarini drew the loss, but more important was the fact that several Bristol pitchers got in a little work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zack Rinkavage, Tyler Martin, and Evan Bouchard all saw time on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Branford collected three runs in the first, three in the second and two in the third to put the game away early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the weather holds, Bristol travels to Newington on Sunday (5 p.m.) and then to Avon the following day from Buckingham Park at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, to end the regular season, Post 2 tangles with Simsbury on August 1 from Memorial Field at 11 a.m.</p>
