<p>In the first set, the Lancers made it look easy as they served very well and the points were mostly quick and easy.</p>

<p>After the first, Eastern coach Stefanie Reay mixed and matched all of her players, spreading playing time over the entire roster.  </p>

<p>Mills stiffened their defense in the second period, and actually had a good chance to win the set, as they led 24-21 and had 3 set points.  But Eastern ran off 5 points in rapid succession and suddenly the set was over.</p>
