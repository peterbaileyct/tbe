<p>BRISTOL – Roberto Cruz, one of the many talented pitchers from the Bristol American Legion Baseball team, earned his first starting assignment of the season against Wallingford this past Saturday night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was an exhibition contest that went right down to the wire.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Cruz was tough, allowing the opponents minimal production at the plate and while Post 2 didn’t create much offense on the flip side, the game was decided by the locals over the final inning of play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the bases loaded and one out, Jack Kozikowski dropped in an infield hit – scoring Austin Brown from third base – as Bristol walked off with a 1-0 victory over Wallingford from Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win propelled Bristol to 2-1 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz was sharp, going the distance, and allowing only two hits as the Bristol Central chucker got the job done.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had only four hits for the game, but it was just enough in the end as Cruz cruised for his first win on the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz needed just 87 pitches to defeat Wallingford and expect a couple more starts and some relief efforts along the way this summer for the chucker.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bristol Jr. Legion drops first two games of the season &nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The West Hartford Junior American Legion program traveled to Riley Field in Bristol this past Sunday and swept the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game scores were 6-1 and 10-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol led 1-0 in that first showdown as pitcher Jaydon Churchill allowed just one run over the first five frames of play for Post 2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the sixth stanza, Bristol gave up four runs and yielded another in the seventh to fall by five runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the immediate rematch – with West Hartford positioned as the home team – Post 2 dropped a tough 10-0 decision.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was just a 1-0 contest through two tilts but a five-run third ended the game for the locals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Allan drew the loss for Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The juniors of Bristol get right back at it this Wednesday as the team travels to Torrington for a Zone 1 engagement from Fuessenich Park at 5 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Saturday, Bristol returns to Riley Field on Saturday to battle Simsbury in a single bout at 4 p.m. &nbsp;</p>
