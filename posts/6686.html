<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NEWINGTON – The Bristol American Legion Baseball squad is at the top of the Zone 1 food chain as of July 22.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And though it took a game or two to get there, Post 2 has 11 wins in Zone 1 action, tying Meriden for the lead in the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current ledger is a far cry from where the locals started the campaign back on June 10.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve played well,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta after beating Newington on Tuesday. “Like I’ve said before, we started off [at] 1-3.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off setbacks to West Hartford (4-3 loss on June 10), Avon (10-1, June 15), and Naugatuck (4-2, June 19), Post 2 lost three of its first four contests before a showdown at Newington from Legend’s Field on June 20 flipped the whole campaign around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the seventh inning of that Newington showdown, Bristol was leading 3-1 and tried to close out the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Newington posted two runs on four hits in the seventh stanza to tie up the contest - forcing an extra frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended up notching two runs in the top of the ninth and pitcher Roberto Cruz retired Newington in order in the eighth to help Bristol win, 5-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From that point of the season, Post 2 started a huge winning streak - seizing 10 of its last 11 Zone 1 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When we came here (to Newington), we were 1-3 and were ahead 3-1 [against Newington] and blew it,” said LaPenta. “And they tied up 3-3. We were looking at 1-4 but since that [come from behind win], we’ve gone 10-1.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s still a half-dozen Zone 1 games to play and Bristol has its collective sights on winning the division and making a little noise in the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Even if we somehow lose out on the tie-breaker [for the Regional Qualifier], we still have a good chance to win the zone,” said LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best part is the kids are still in the mix, competing and will play some sort of postseason baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only thing they are not hoping for is more rain which gave the squad an unanticipated stretch of postponed games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s been fun so far,” said LaPenta. “We had the eight days of just [doggy doo-doo] with the rain.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Catchers on the DL&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the M.A.S.H. (that means Mobile Army Surgical Hospital to you youngsters) unit was active and available, just about the entire catching corps from Bristol would be in that field tent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catcher is the toughest position to fill on a baseball team and LaPenta was left with limited choices to choose from on the roster when the Newington contest rolled around.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve had some kids nicked up tonight,” said LaPenta. “Nate [Ouellette’s] thumb is all swollen. He couldn’t catch.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ouellette hurt himself at the Berlin contest, attempting to catch the rockets pitcher Mike Lorenzetti was chucking on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Stickels would have been in line to catch but a shoulder injury is keeping him out of the line-up, while standout Owen Davis is on vacation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With option A, B, and C unavailable, jack-of-all-trades Zach Rinkavage was pressed into duty and the usual third basemen hung tough behind the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s the definition of a baseball player and wherever LaPenta needs Rinkavage to play, the outstanding athlete always accepts the challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He did a good job,” said LaPenta of Rinkavage. “He only caught one other time all year. He did a great job back there.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was big for Zach to be back there. He did a great job I thought.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Records as of Wednesday&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 1 has Bristol and Meriden on top of the Zone 1 standings at 11-4 while West Hartford is a full game back at 10-5.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck is in fourth place at 9-5, Avon fell to fifth (8-6) while Newington - blanking Berlin 6-0 last night - is 6-9 in Zone 1 play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do the other zone’s look in terms of record?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the state, American Legion baseball has five other zones - all playing in competitive divisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 2 has Madison (16-3) one full game in front of Wallingford (16-5) while old friend RCP (15-3) is in first place by two games over NCL Windsor Locks/Windsor (13-5) in Zone 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 4 has an Eastern and Western conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the East, Fairfield (19-5) is running away with the zone while Greenwich (18-6) is a half-game ahead of Danbury (18-7) in the West.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in Zone 6, seven teams are divided into two divisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Northern Division, Tri-Town (10-7) carries a half-game lead over Willimantic (9-7) while on the Southern side, Waterford (17-2) is running away with the zone.</p>
