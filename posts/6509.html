<p>“The project includes the rehabilitation of the Memorial Boulevard Bridge and is part of the State/Local bridge program,” said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. “Up until now, one lane has been opened while we were waiting for the DOT to issue the final permits. However, effective Monday, July 19, both of the east and westbound lanes from Downs Street to East Street will no longer be accessible.”<br></p>

<p>“Detours are in place during the Memorial Boulevard Bridge replacement, said Councilman<br>Peter Kelley, a member of the Public Works Commission. “As a reminder, from Mellon Street<br>westbound, we are down to one lane as the retaining wall damage is completed.”<br></p>

<p>The City of Bristol is asking for the cooperation of motorists in avoiding the area for the duration of the project.  The project is scheduled to be completed by December of 2021.</p>
