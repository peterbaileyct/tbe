<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central JV boys basketball team had its hands full against crosstown rival Bristol Eastern on Friday, February 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams ended up going on a big second half run to give the visiting squad an eventual double-digit lead en route to a 57-48 victory from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had just seven players available but each athlete contributed to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason Stokes dropped in a game-high 19 points while teammate Julius Powel added 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was even more balance as Mike Allan added nine points, Aaron Brown and Dan Astacio scored six apiece while Tre Blair tallied five to lead the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nate Fries led Eastern with 13 points to go along with five rebounds and six steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Dauphinais played well, coming up with 12 points, three rebounds, and five steals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Max Stavens (six points) hit two three-pointers and grabbed three rebounds while Lukas Sward rounded up five points, dished out six assists and scooped in four steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, employing a big line-up with Powel firing away in the middle, out-rebounded the Lancers by a 2-to-1 margin but was forced into 29 turnovers which kept the contest close until the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern attempted 38 three-pointers, connecting on 11 while Central was 6-of-12 overall from downtown for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers committed just 11 turnovers but just couldn’t keep pace offensively over the final 12 minutes of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nine lead changes and three ties highlighted a busy back-and-forth affair that was all knotted up at 28-28 when halftime commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern canned four threes over the first eight minutes of play as a long-range connection by Dauphinais made it a 16-11 game in the home team’s favor with 2:23 left to play in the period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading by three (16-13) after one, Eastern increased its edge to 25-18 on a Dauphinais lay-up with 3:10 remaining before the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central’s defense picked up as a 10-0 run - highlighted by 3s from Stokes and Allan - posted the Rams to a 28-25 edge with thirty seconds to go in the second tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fries then hit a late 3 to close out the scoring as the teams were all notched up at 28-28 going into intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stokes scored Central’s first seven points of the third frame to give the visitors a two-point edge but a 3 by Fries saw the Lancers capture a 36-35 lead with 5:15 to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams then used a 16-2 burst to make it a 51-38 game with 5:25 left to play - all but sinking the Lancers in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never gave up and dropped the deficit to single digits late as a steal and layup from Sward chopped the score to 53-45 with 3:26 remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams went up by double-figures one more time before a 3 by Eastern’s Connor Cyr ended the scoring as Central tallied the victory, 57-48.&nbsp;</p>
