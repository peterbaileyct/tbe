<p>Bristol native and resident Marcus Patton is doing what he can to raise awareness and promote diversity here in town. The 43-year-ESPN employee--he oversees all of the highlights for SportsCenter--and member of the city’s diversity council said that tries to stay above politics, especially when it comes to his role with the diversity council.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet, he is steeped in politics, so to speak: his brother, Morris “Rippy” Patton is chair of the Democratic Town Committee; Marcus is a member of the Republican Party.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was born and raised a Democrat,” said Patton.&nbsp; “A while back I chose to register as Republican in town, from an aspect of diversity, and I bring the Republican Party of voice, that currently isn't in the room.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he shows up to the meetings and opposes anything that doesn't make sense or supports anything that does from the perspective of a regular person and toward diversity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When he attends the meetings, he said that he is significantly in the minority, and a lot of times when topics come up, he is able to talk about those issues from a different perspective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Many people in the room are on the Democratic side of things, obviously it is more diverse there,” said Patton. “Those topics can be covered from a diverse perspective.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“On the Republican side of things, it's a lot harder to do that,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the two groups at a bipartisan level get together, and they have to start making decisions without having both sides of the story, they can’t have those conversations if you don't have voices in the room that represent the people, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton graduated from Bristol Eastern and Southern Connecticut State University. In January of 2001, he started working part-time at ESPN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is still there 20 years later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm currently called a content producer,” said Patton. “My role is to oversee all of the highlights for SportsCenter.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His role on the city’s diversity council began with an invitation from Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu, and one of her initiatives, a Community Conversation on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion back in March 20, 2020, an event spurred on by the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hundreds showed up with lawn chairs, blankets and a desire to spark positive change in Bristol, at the event sponsored by the mayor and the City Council. The conversation at Rockwell Park was facilitated by the Diversity Council, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It's weird because obviously that wasn't necessarily a movement that started in 2020 with George Floyd,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said that was really a movement that dates back to Trayvon Martin, who was an unarmed 17-year-old killed by George Zimmerman on Feb. 26, 2012, sparking national controversy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(The FBI's&nbsp;<a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015">Hate Crimes Statistics, 2015</a>&nbsp;report tallied more than 5,850 hate crime incidents in 2015, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/14/502036699/hate-crimes-rose-in-2015-with-religious-bias-a-growing-motivation-fbi-data-shows">NPR.</a> Most of those — 56.9 percent — were racially motivated, with more than half of race-based attacks targeting African-Americans.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It started to pick up a little bit more steam after these acts around 2015, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And then really just kind of took hold in 2020, in terms of, national protests that involve more than just people of color,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton said that back in its inception, it was so important because for the first time in modern era, it was movement that reached beyond just the community that the issues that were happening in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was an opportunity for people in Connecticut to show support for issues that were happening in Chicago, rather than just seeing the protest,” said Patton. “And the activism happening across the country and going ‘oh my goodness’ this is amazing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Patton, this larger conversation was just an extension of similar conversations in smaller pockets, locally, he said. He credited those conversations for the first steps and opening the gate for future conversations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, he pointed to his experience with local NAACP chapter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A few years back, my brother helped rejuvenate the Bristol chapter of the NAACP with Lexie Mangum,” said Patton. Mangum is the former president of the chapter. Eric Clemons is president now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NAACP presence in Bristol had lapsed, he said, until the group brought it back when Zoppo-Sassu took office in 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Having that conversation up and running, really helped build the infrastructure for a lot of the conversations that are currently happening, to take hold,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton often posed on Facebook. In one he detailed what he was doing and why he was doing it, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I urge those from the LGBTQ community to find circles where they're not represented, and to be a voice and to be an advocate,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I urge those of lower incomes, to find circles where they're not represented and represent themselves.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This resulted in a discussion about how to get computers to students during the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The topic at hand was, if we should charge these families $25 per computer for insurance in case any of the kids, have issues, or their computers go missing,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another more obvious conversation revolves around racism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a black man, Patton has faced it his entire life. This experience informs his role on the diversity council.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I went through elementary school, almost at all times being the only kid of color in my class,” said Patton. “Then the few other kids of color in my school would essentially be the only kids of color in their class.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton said at that time they didn't have the awareness at school to really know, and at recess, they didn't really gravitate towards each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“At that age, and in that era in the 80s for kids of color in Connecticut, and more specifically, outside of the inner cities in Connecticut, there was a lot of naiveness,” said Patton.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During that time, he thought all kids at school were getting that type of treatment, but now years later, he realized it was him.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm happy to say I didn't grow up with a ton of violence due to my color,” said Patton. “It was really just more of social issues.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He recalled that one of the first girls he ever had a crush on in fourth grade, called him the “N” word, when he told her that I had a crush her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I remember another girl that I was actually dating in eighth grade, and I had to pick up, her father made her break up with me due to my color,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said kids are honest, and it was more of those type of things rather than living in a place where people were constantly driving by throwing things at you and driving by yelling things at you, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I spend most of my time with my family so I'm often and always around people of color, so at times kind of get to the perception of what you're seeing, which is really what you surround your environment from.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He does what he can to open the conversation beyond black and white voices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an example, he said, after one of his Facebook posts, a person of Asian heritage contacted him about how to get involved with the diversity council.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The person said, “Hey, I'm really feeling like now's the time that I can get involved and start to help, but I'm not really sure how.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He invited her to attend and the person showed up and was awesome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm trying to help the city become a more balanced city by being a voice in a group where there isn't representation,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We need representation from a complete diverse slate, whether it's income, whether it's cultural background language and art.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is really more about this, he said, that he is trying to get across, that it’s about representation in town, and to be on the frontlines of changing as a community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He credits Zoppo-Sassu for that, being an objective of hers to making that happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Incidently, the Diversity Council chairs a former ESPN colleague, Jeff Israel, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For himself, he said he takes on these responsibilities because it is who he is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I know I'm a good person, I was raised that way, my values are there, it's genuine,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I feel like having that ability, it puts me in a place where I can serve that role, and try to be, and at least allow myself to be an example for any others.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just recently finished our mission statement, but what we're trying to do with the Diversity Council, is to create an avenue for those to be able to flourish in a diverse landscape here in Bristol,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city’s diversity council meets regularly on the fourth Tuesday of the month at City Hall. Check the city website for times.</p>

<h2><strong>Subhead here</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being a Bristol native, understanding that Bristol is doing its best to promote diversity, it is no surprise that Marcus Patton encourages people to think about Bristol as a place to live and encourages them to consider Bristol, not only as a place of diversity but a place to raise children here and to start businesses here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Admittedly, he said, he and his wife, Tracy, have considered living in other places, among them Covington and Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the truth of the matter is that, he said, diversity just isn't there, with two biracial kids, and neither he nor his wife are interested in having them be an overwhelming minority within their school system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said not only are people with families seeking diversity overall but specifically a diverse education for the children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think that if family of color were to look at the census and see that it's only 5 percent, that would be concerning,” said Patton.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, he said, the diversity council is addressing the issue. Patton is a member of the council.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, the council had a zoom call with NBC, Connecticut, recently, about joining forces with NBC in order to help get the message out, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he hopes to inspire more towns to do that and show people that this is a city that cares about diversity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Again, the rejuvenation of the NAACP has been huge so that parents can know that there is a fighting force for them in this town,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He addition he pointed to his brother, Morris “Rippy” Patton, who chairs the Democratic Town Committee. Maurice is registered as a Republican.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Rippy” was named as one of the top 100 men of color two years ago, Patton said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said seeing his brother in the local newspaper and that he was a part of publications out there is really just to show those looking to move here that there are a lot of positives going on in Bristol for people of color.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The overwhelming support from all people in town and when I say all people, I don't mean everyone but, you know, a diverse slate of people showing support to the Black Lives Matter movement showing support for the NAACP showing support for the city's Diversity Council,” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, Patton pointed to statistics that indicate the city’s diversity rate is nearing 50 percent diversity in the school system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parents can move here or people can move here knowing that at least the numbers in the school system are showing an overwhelming attention towards diversity, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Those are the things the city has already done to help get the message out there to welcoming more people of color,” said Patton. “I think going forward, it's really going to take a lot of openness, from those of color interested in checking out Bristol and open to be a part of the growth.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding work and business opportunities, he said Bristol is a city, so there are not a lot of city type jobs here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the larger companies, tobacco, construction, that's family owned is by the Barnes, who were among those who originally here and remain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, he said, “We're a city that really runs like a small town, it's true.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;For example, he said, “In terms of restaurant businesses, you have J.R. Rusgrove and he's got three restaurants.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As as aside, Patton said that a couple weeks ago, he walked into Cafe Real and had a discussion with the owner, Eduardo Garces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Garces who's Colombian, asked me, ‘why do you think that we're not seeing more of a rise in black owned businesses here in Bristol?’” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He's like, ‘I think, you know it's really strange for me because it feels like the time is perfect, and we're just not seeing it.’”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton said that both men talked about what those reasons could be, and that opportunity is prime, right now, for a lot of people of color to come in and start more black-owned businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It isn’t a place where, minorities can just come into town and go okay I'm going to look at the job postings, apply here, we don't have that here,” said Patton.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said Bristol is more of a mom and pop, a lot of small businesses and it seems to be all about who you know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This led Patton to recall a conversation he had the previous week with two friends and colleagues about deciding where to buy homes: Marco Alfandary [Caucasian], Terrell Bouza [African American].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bouza is in journalism and lives in Farmington, and Alfandary lives in Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Obviously both Terrell and I are men of color, Marco is not,” said Patton.&nbsp; “Marco was saying that he is searching for another home with his will soon-to-be wife.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said where he lives there is visibly, not many people of color, although someone on his block is dating a man of color, and he always stands out like a sore thumb whenever he comes to visit because it's so few and far between.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I bring it up because I had mentioned, if someone were to ask me, ‘Hey Marcus you're from Connecticut and we're moving there we want to go to an area where there's diversity, do you know a good, slated diversity?’” said Patton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At least in the Harford County area, he said that he would bring up, Bristol, Waterbury, South Windsor, and Bloomfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outside of those cities, there is probably still a heavy minority population in other cities, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of it comes from, when high school teams play and you go to games and you see half their team is, black or Puerto Rican and, that is the traveling visual of the demographic, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I resort to that visual representation of demographics, which happens to be used sports,” said Patton.</p>
