<p>SPRINGFIELD, MA - Western Connecticut State University junior Myah Croze has done it once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant more scoring exploits for the women’s soccer program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, she kicked in another game-winning goal on Sunday - helping WestConn to a 2-1 triumph over Western New England College in a non-conference affair from Suprenant Field in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WestConn is now 2-0 on the season while the Golden Bears fell to 1-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The four-year Bristol Eastern star already has three goals on the young season for the Western program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the forward from Bristol, an unrelenting bulldog on the field, scored two goals in the double overtime win on Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow Bristol Eastern teammate Karly Martin was sensational in the goal for the second straight match as the keeper scooped in 10 saves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Croze had the Western New England goal under fire the entire afternoon, taking five shots at the net — connecting on two to help her squad get to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was scoreless over the first half of play but quickly into the second session, Croze cashed in on a goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the 58th minute of play, teammate Suzana Imetovski found Croze closing in as she jabbed the ball into the top-right corner of the goal to put WestConn on top 1-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Golden Bears later tied things up at 1-1 and after the completion of regulation, two extra sessions were needed to determine a winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin made two huge saves in overtime and Croze connected on the game-winner at the 105:03 mark of the showdown as WestConn kicked up a huge 2-1 victory to stay undefeated on the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Martin named Goalkeeper of the Week</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an outstanding weekend in the net, Martin was named Little East Conference Goalkeeper of the Week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the two WestConn wins, Martin allowed just two goals while scooping in 20 saves to earn weekly honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against WPI on Saturday, Martin collected 10 saves in the 2-1 win while the following day, in the overtime victory, she added another ten to turn away the Golden Bears</p>

<p><strong>WCSU was picked second in the LEC preseason Coaches' Poll</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WestConn, the 2019 LEC tournament runner-up, was picked to finish second this season in the 2021 LEC Preseason Coaches' Poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Western totaled 55 points and two first-place votes in the poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze and Martin, both First-Team all-LEC starters in 2019, helped to make WestConn a top conference selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Next up…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Western is finally home for a match this Wednesday as the locals welcome Ramapo College to Danbury from the Westside Athletics Complex at 2 p.m.</p>
