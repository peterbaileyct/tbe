<p>In terms in the best baseball players from the Mum City in the 2000s, former Bristol Eastern standout Sean Allaire was a special player that came through several Bristol programs, performing at the highest level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a model player that rarely struck out and played every inning like it was his last.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an outstanding career for the Lancers and the Bristol American Legion baseball program, Allaire moved on to Central Connecticut State University and was one of the best players to ever suit up for the squad.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allaire was the 2010 Northeast Conference player of the Year at Central Connecticut as a senior.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had a spectacular campaign, helping the Blue Devils win 33 games and the Northeast Conference championship.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allaire batted a team-leading .426 and wrangled up 100 hits, tying a school record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He set the single-season school ledger for doubles (22) and tied the mark for RBIs (73).</p>

<p>He also earned All-Region honors from the ABCA and New England Intercollege Baseball Association All-New England First Team accolades, in addition to being named All-NEC twice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following graduation from CCSU, Allaire played in independent professional baseball leagues, splitting the 2011 season between the Washington Wild Things of the Frontier League and the Las Cruces Vagueros of the Pecos League.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Longevity and a dedication to the sport was what fueled Allaireâ€™s outstanding career that lasted into the Tri-State Baseball League in the mid 2010s.</p>
