<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Middletown then retook the lead with 31 seconds to go in the first as the home team etched up a 23-17 advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But from there, the Lancers went on a blazing 16-0 run as Collins scored half the points over the jaunt.</p>

<p>To end the run, Doyon and Emma Stavens (two points, four rebounds) hit hoops with Eastern zipping up a 33-23 lead with 3:55 remaining before the half.</p>

<p>The third quarter saw the Lancers score the first five points of the period, taking a 42-34 lead when Doyon dished to Scarritt for two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But an 18-8 run saw Middletown toast up a 50-48 tally with eight minutes remaining in regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth quarter, the teams traded baskets for the first four minutes but Collins nailed down her floater with 5:20 remaining to help Eastern score up a 61-58 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
