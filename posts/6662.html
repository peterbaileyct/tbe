<h2><strong>Bear spotted off Farmington Ave</strong>.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>At approximately 9:30 Wednesday morning, a bear was spotted on Boardman St., just off Rte. 6.  Initially, the bear was 100 ft. from the corner of Boardman and Farmington Ave/Rte 6.  He moseyed to within feet of a workman, who just arrived to clean a bird’s nest at No. 15 Boardman. </h5>

<h5>The startled workman fled while the unassuming bear continued his journey, making his way to the Bristol Hospital Rehab building on Farmington Ave. The bear then reversed his path back to Boardman, then changed course again, crossing the street, and was last spotted leisurely heading to the apartment buildings.</h5>

<h2><strong>Mayor and health director issue statement on $300 million pharmaceutical settlement </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu and Health District Director Marco Palmeri issued a statement today concerning the $300 million proposed settlement for the State of Connecticut, of which 15 percent or $45 million, will be distributed to the cities and towns. </h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>“This is a landmark moment for the opioid crisis and the public health epidemic that we have been fighting for the last few years,” said Zoppo-Sassu. “We know that Bristol families have been struggling and we have worked to eliminate the stigma and create pathways for recovery. These include the City Council establishing the City of Bristol as a ‘Recovery Friendly Community’. This designation, as defined by the Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Policy Council, identifies communities that have programs to support residents who are in recovery from substance abuse disorders.</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>"The good news for Bristol is that we have several substantive accomplishments already under our belt, and will be in a very good position to receive additional funds from the state’s Opioid Recovery &amp; Remediation Fund Advisory Council,” the mayor continued.</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>“The City of Bristol, like many other communities throughout the country, is plagued by the Opioid crisis. Despite the tremendous progress the Mayor’s Opioid Taskforce has made to bring awareness to this disease, encourage recovery and to eliminate barriers to recovery services, the frequency of overdoses has not decreased. So it is especially encouraging to hear that CT will be receiving substantial funds from the opioid distributor’s settlement. These funds are needed to get to the root causes of this disease, teach prevention strategies and provide supportive services to get folks back to being productive members of our communities,” said Palmeri.</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Over the past three years, under Zoppo-Sassu's administration, the city has been active in addressing the opioid crisis, having launched a task force, being designated as a "Recovery Friendly Community" and establishing a collaboration among health care providers and the Bristol Police Department in conjunction with Bristol Health, operating under the City of Bristol Recovery Alliance Program or COBRA.</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>For her efforts, the mayor has received a Government Sector All-Star Award from the Connecticut Association of Prevention Professionals. </h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Last year, the Mayor's Task Force won a Silver Telly Award for its ad campaign featuring vignettes that tell the story of some of the Bristol families affected by substance misuse."</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>The Youth &amp; Community Services Department also sponsors the Best-4-Bristol group which is a peer group of young people encouraging other young people to avoid using drugs, vaping, and other substance abuse issues.</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Those interested in learning more about the City’s efforts should visit the Opioid Task Force page on the <a href="https://www.bristolct.gov/929/Opioid-Task-Force">https://www.bristolct.gov/929/Opioid-Task-Force</a> website or call the Mayor's Office at (860) 584-6250.   </h5>
