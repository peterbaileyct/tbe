<p>January 18 wasn’t a popular date for the Bristol Eastern boys basketball team to compete on, but every once in awhile, the Lancers battled their crosstown rival that day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the squads from Bristol Central and Eastern took the court on January 18, 2008.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown, played from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium, went down as a classic in city series lore.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest pitted teacher versus student as Eastern’s Mike Giovinazzo took on Central’s Tim Barrette – one of Giovinazzo’s many former players that ended up coaching basketball scholastically.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that hardwood bout, Central held a double-figure lead over Eastern in the fourth quarter but the Lancers were able to capitalize defensively and&nbsp; play catch up in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A huge game-winning shot by Eastern’s Chris Colon at the buzzer sent the crowd into a frenzy as the Lancers came-from-behind to snare a huge 60-59 win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an amazing spectacle as both squads were trending in different directions as the game between the programs approached.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central entered the contest at 3-7 but was looking for one fleeting victory to change the course of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had explosive guard DaQuan Brooks who could score against anyone and could break down opposing defenses with his slick inside-outside attack (Giovinazzo had, what seemed like, twenty defenses prepared for the sharpshooter, going over and over those at practices leading up to the game).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central also turned to Dan Olivo, St. Paul transfer Tyler McIntyre, Demetric Maisonet, Dan Owsianko, and Devin Pecevich on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a strange side note, Jake Hasler somehow played for both Bristol Eastern and Bristol Central that year. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central faced challenges, losing four straight games – dropping three by nine points or less – before scoring a 53-49 win over Maloney on January 15 as the program had some momentum going into the Eastern challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, on the flip side, were finally putting everything together – hanging in at 5-5 and looked to be tournament bound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fueled by Cody Bayne, who eventually became the program’s second all-time leading scorer (1,058 points), Eastern was experiencing a turnaround with Brett Anderson, Tylon Holmes, Jordon Dias, Tommy Tarantino, Timmy Georgen, Xavier Wade, and Colon leading the charge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Lancers’ crew helped turn around an 0-4 start to the year and once things clicked defensively and the offensive started to flow, the team hit the pay window early and often.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers entered the Central showdown winning four out of their last five games which included a season best 48-point victory against Fermi and a 44-point demolition of Conard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that night against Central, all the records were thrown out the window - per usual - between the squads. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And trailing late, the Lancers went to work, down 59-58.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With six seconds left to play and Eastern in possession of the ball, Anderson received the inbound pass and zipped it up to Dias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dias made a quick dribble and chucked the ball over to Colon on the baseline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colon then coolly sank a 16-foot baseline jumper at the buzzer as the Eastern fans erupted – leading to the one-point victory for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first win in the rivalry at the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium for Eastern since 2001.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers used an 11-0 run over the final 4:29 of the game to hold off the Rams as a free throw from Olivo made it a 59-49 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central never scored again, missing all of its remaining field goal attempts and went 0-for-3 from the charity stripe down the stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bayne quickly connected on a conventional three-point play and then kicked in two free throws with 2:10 left to make it a 59-54 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central followed with a missed a hoop and when Bayne flipped in a driving lay-up, Eastern trailed by just three points, 59-56, with 1:38 remaining in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams still couldn’t score a basket but off an Eastern miss, Tarantino nabbed the offensive rebound, was fouled and hit two free throws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with 50 seconds remaining, the deficit was cut to 59-58 as Central’s double-figure edge was chopped to one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olivo and McIntrye missed one-and-one opportunities late and with eight seconds to go, the game-winning play was drawn up for Colon as he canned the go-ahead basket that sealed the deal at 60-59.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooks was sensational again, scoring all of his game-high 26 points over the first 27:11 of the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olivo added eight points while McIntyre and Owsianko scored seven points apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bayne dropped in 23 points and 11 rebounds - connecting on seven of Eastern’s final 11 points over the final four minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colon nabbed a double-double of 12 points and 11 rebounds, Anderson zipped in 14 points and four rebounds along with four 3-pointers and Georgen slipped in four points and six assists while playing excellent defense on Brooks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tarantino added four points and three rebounds in just six minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led 21-15 after eight minutes of play but a 15-6 second period run by the Rams gave the home squad a 30-27 lead at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An Anderson 3 with one second left to play in the third trimmed the deficit to 48-45 but 10 straight fourth quarter points by Brooks boosted Central’s cushion to 58-47 - the squad’s biggest lead of the evening - with 4:49 to go in the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From that point on in the showdown, Central hit only one free throw as a game-ending 13-1 jaunt by Eastern propelled the winners to the 60-59 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central got revenge on February 20, sinking Eastern over a 58-51 final from the Thomas M .Monahan Gymnasium, though Colon dropped 26 points on the Rams. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team on the hill was on fire – winning its seventh straight game with its victories over the Lancers – to scratch and claw to 10-10 overall record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on March 3, Central was the 26<sup>th</sup> ranked team in the Class L tournament bracket, engaged in a war at No. 7 Branford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals nearly toppled the squad but, in the end, the Rams fell 57-56 as the season came to a swift conclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers ended the year with a more than respectable 14-9 ledger with Eastern grabbing its best record since the 2002-03 season (11-11).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program qualified for the CCC Tournament as the eighth seed, falling to No. 1 Windsor 64-55 in a contest played from Bristol Central high school (thank you Home Show).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern earned a 14<sup>th</sup> ranking in the Class L tournament fray and saw some early postseason success.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were able to top No. 19 Farmington and high-scoring Spencer Noon by a 58-46 final on March 3 before dropping a 66-46 decision in second round play at No. 3 New Canaan on March 5.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Canaan used a 1-3-1 defensive zone that employed a 6-foot-8 center on top, giving Eastern a great re-look at a classic tactic that they started to use with players like Tyrell Holmes over future seasons.&nbsp;</p>
