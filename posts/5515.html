<p>MERIDEN - With the Panthers’ top pitcher in the dugout on crutches, an anticipated pitcher’s duel between the Bristol Eastern and Platt softball programs never materialized.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were able to capitalize early and often over an 18-2 victory in a CCC South tilt from Meriden on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 9-5 off the win, avenging a 16-1 loss the previous day to powerhouse Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers (7-7) had to turn to three different pitchers, trailed by fifteen runs before finally getting on the scoreboard - allowing the entire Lancers’ team to contribute to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We needed to bounce back after yesterday,” against Berlin said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “It was unfortunate that we couldn’t see their best [pitcher] because this would have been a good game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even without star pitcher Emily Hart, the Panthers threw everything but the kitchen sink at the Lancers from the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Platt never quit, refused to lose by a straight 15-0 mercy-rule finish and made the visitors work at the end to earn it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have to tip my cap to Platt,” said Redman. “I told [the Platt players] after the game, that was the most heart I’ve seen this year against any team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a game that could have been sloppy, Eastern had a flawless defensive effort to highlight an all-around excellent day of ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals faced just three batters over the minimum as Eastern star chucker Ali Tellier allowed just three hits, no walks and posted seven strikeouts over an efficient effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I told them from the get-go, I want a clean game defensively,” said Redman. “Obviously, Ali is pitching with confidence with that big lead but, like I told them in the pregame, Platt is a pesky team. They’re quality, they have some real quality hitters - especially at the top of their order. You’re trying to work ahead. I think Ali started off every single batter with a first pitch strike which was pretty amazing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern tallied three runs in the first inning as Tellier singled to left, Riley Giblin was hit-by-pitch and Jasmine Perez (3-for-4, four runs scored, HR, five RBI) dropped in an RBI tally to center to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Policki then walked on four pitches to loads things up and Jazmyn Brown (three RBI) skied a ball to center for an out but on the sacrifice, Giblin scored, and a 2-0 push followed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the frame, Alex Shorette (two RBI) smashed a single to left and when Perez scored, Eastern led 3-0 through just a half-inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, the Lancers added 11 runs to the till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Lacouture and Tellier drew walks and while Giblin’s fielder’s choice erased the lead runner, Perez earned a base-on-balls to load the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Janessa Gonzalez (2-for-3, two RBI) sent a base hit to center to plate pinch runner Sarah Snedeker and when Policki walked for the second time, Giblin scored from third to give Eastern a 5-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RBI base-on-balls by Browne and Shorette gave Eastern another couple tallies on the board as the Kingstreeters nabbed a 7-0 push with just one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saniya Carraway then came into pitch for the Panthers, but she ended up walking Makayla Antunes for an RBI as the Lancers secured an 8-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lacouture then came to the plate in the inning for the second time as Eastern had batted around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also drew a bases loaded walk and off a pickoff attempt, the Platt catcher threw the ball into right field as two players tagged the dish and an 11-0 Eastern push ensued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riley also walked to re-load the bases and Perez bounced a ball off the wall in center for another RBI single. - making it a 12-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez also earned a bases loaded walk - as did Browne - for another couple runs as the Lancers ended the second stanza ahead by a 14-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After three consecutive groundouts by Platt in the first inning, Tellier struck out the side in the second as the score remained 14-0 going into the third frame of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the third, Antunes dropped a double into left, Tellier reached on a one-out error and even as reserve Ashley Serafin grounded out, Antunes scored to make it 15-0 through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier fanned batters four and five in the bottom of the third as the Eastern chucker was perfect through nine batters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez and Sophia Nocera opened the fourth frame with back-to-back walks and Browne grounded out to advance both runners into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But an unusual first base to home plate double-play ended the inning with the Lancers still in front by 15 runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the top of the order for the Panthers in the fourth and the home team showed some life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt’s Ariana Soto sent a double into left, advanced to third on a groundout and scored on a passed ball to make it a 15-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tori Talento then scorched a two-base hit to left, as did Thalia Ortiz, with the second double making it 15-2 but Eastern was still firmly in control through four frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They didn’t go away,” said Redman of Platt. “Platt bounces back. You think it’s just going to be a walkover, mercy-ruled [game]. They bounce back and score a couple. They didn’t break up [Ali’s] no-hitter with a bunt a single or a little blooper. It was a well-placed ball and a couple more well-struck hits, nothing cheap about it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Perez blasted the ball out of the park to give the Lancers an 18-2 cushion - the final runs of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antunes and Serafin both walked and on a 2-0 pitch, Perez absolutely crushed a shot over the fence in center as the three-run homer gave Eastern a 16-run lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I like the way that we answered,” said Redman. “We didn’t bounce back going on a passed ball or anything. Jazmyn Perez gets into it and tags one - the second game in a row that she hits one out. That’s really good to see her red hot."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez then sent a single up the middle but ended up stranded as Platt had to score a couple to stay away from being mercy ruled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier went 1-2-3 in the bottom of the fifth to close it out as Eastern nabbed an 18-2 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought we came in here and did what we had to do,” said Redman. “We got some [other] girls in and they contributed as well. That was good to see.”</p>
