The March issue of Connecticut Magazine's cover reads "Breakfast: 23 Great Spots To Start Your Day," so when I was getting the mail and saw this, I dropped what I was doing and opened the magazine to the section. You guessed it, I was looking for Bristol's Parkside Cafe. And I found it on p. 59 tucked between the listing for Eastford's Coriander Cafe and Storrs' Toast, Four Corners in a section on brunches.

It's a short piece that begins with an anecdote about J.R. Rusgrove proclaiming at 14 years old that he will have a business around the corner from his childhood home on Federal Hill. Voila! It's a short piece, but it carries the weight of the magazine and its influence. So it is nice to see a Bristol establishment being recognized for its accomplishments. It's great for the Rusgroves. It's great for Bristol.

We know that Parkside, and its sibling, Main Street Pint &amp; Plate, have garnered praise in the past. Connecticut Magazine had mentioned the Pint &amp; Plate's brussels sprouts. They are that good. Both have a following, drawing from a wide swath of territory, something that I can confirm with this little story of my own.

The last time Mary and I were at breakfast, a week or two ago, waiting in line, I struck up a conversation with a gentleman from out of town, who had arranged a breakfast business meeting. He said he had heard about this place, referring of course to Parkside, and wanted to check it out. He didn't mind the wait, and at one point, when offered a seat at the high table by the window, declined because he and his guest had work to do and needed a bigger table.

To paraphrase Emerson, make something worthwhile and the world will beat a path to your door.
