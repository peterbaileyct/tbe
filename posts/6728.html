<p>The Bristol American Legion Baseball team - the current Zone 1 leader - did not get invited to the Regional Qualifier this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means that if the best team in Zone 1 actually wins its division, which Bristol is on pace to do, it won’t have a chance to qualify for the Northeast Regional Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the program is still on pace to be a major contender in the state tournament bracket and winning the Connecticut championship isn’t a bad consolation prize.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Regional Qualifier math in qualification for the tournament is a bit perplexing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First off, you have to be a NASA rocket scientist to figure out how the two squads from Zone 1 - one tied with Bristol on July 22, the day the selections were made - and the other one which was a full game behind Post 2, qualified over the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant first place Meriden (11-4 at the time) and West Hartford (10-5) both ended up getting the green light for the special tournament while Bristol (11-4) ended up with door number three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you ever watched that game show ‘Let’s Make a Deal,’ you know what door number three leads to (usually it was a real life donkey pulling a cart or something silly along those lines).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol has an excellent shot at winning the zone and then moving on to the state tournament where anything can happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s just disappointing that Bristol won’t make up part of the Regional Qualifier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 1-3 start, the Bristol program has gone 11-1 in Zone 1 action and is now 12-4 - a game in front of second place Meriden (11-5) and a game-and-a-half over West Hartford (10-5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The zone leader in all five divisions earned a slot in the Regional Qualifier and were ranked according by record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Top seeded Waterford led the group while Madison was the runner-up, ranked second in the Regional Qualifier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RCP earned the third seed, Fairfield took fourth while Meriden was fifth to complete the seeding of the zone leaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wallingford was the best second place team out of the bunch and earned the sixth seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rest of the group included second place finishers NCL (No. 7), Greenwich (No. 8), West Hartford (No. 9), and Norwich (No. 10).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first games were held on Saturday as No. 7 NCL defeated No. 10 Norwich by a 3-0 final while No. 8 Greenwich spun No. 9 West Hartford, 7-4, in single elimination play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Games continued today with all eight teams in action - entering a double-elimination format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Games will continue to be held at the higher seed until July 29 when Muzzy Field will host the semifinals and final round of the qualifier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tomfoolery</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of July 22, No. 10 Norwich was 11-7 while Bristol held an 11-4 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How did all those team leapfrog Bristol?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The world may never know…</p>
