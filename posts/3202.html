<p>At 10:30 a.m. voting is continuing at a brisk pace after an early morning rush that had lines snaking along sidewalks and into parking areas in some places.</p>

<p>Unofficial totals provided by Democratic Deputy Registrar Tracy Beland report that 7,526 voters, or 20.2 percent of Bristol's 37,169 registered voters, had been to the polls in person. </p>
