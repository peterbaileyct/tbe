<p>The week dragged on, in some way three weeks long rather than one, and I can’t help thinking it had as much to do with coronavirus and the announcement of the vaccinations entering Phase 1, as much as it did with the attack on the&nbsp;nation’s&nbsp;Capitol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a lot.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what did I do? I slowed down and waited for more information to filter its way&nbsp;over the airwaves and via the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And,&nbsp;I went to work every day. And&nbsp;I taught my classes—seven of them—taught in my mask, socially distancing myself from the students (most are remote learners anyhow).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I continued to wash my hands throughout each day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I continued to read and listen to the latest reports coming out of the Capitol, with an increasing sense of concern, especially with reports about more attacks&nbsp;anticipated on inauguration day, Jan. 20.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And,&nbsp;I mourned for the loss of our standing as a democratic light for the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As reports of troops marching&nbsp;into the&nbsp;nation’s Capitol&nbsp;and to state capitols, I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder, and I heard a voice murmuring in my ear words of consolation, “Only this time, it’s necessary.” I found little comfort since I cannot separate these images from ones of other countries where democracy is only a dream.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come Saturday, the first day of the Martin Luther King Jr Day long weekend,&nbsp;I set aside some time to replace a bunch of smoke alarms, where I did find consolation in physical labor, taking down and putting back up again. All in all, I spent a couple of hours.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The irony of working with smoke alarms was not lost on me: Here I am taking steps to protect my home in the event a fire, a catastrophe, might occur,&nbsp;planning ahead&nbsp;so as not to get caught unaware, and our country has been caught&nbsp;unaware—kind&nbsp;of. There was plenty of smoke, and there continues to be.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you and I know the old cliche—where there is smoke, there is fire.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With D.C., the signs have been there all along, this encounter was inevitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking care of a home can be overwhelming. Get behind and watch out. No different with a democracy. A couple of things go unattended and look what happens.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, in my post-Capitol attack and pre-inaugural state of mind, through which coronavirus continues to poke and prod at any semblance of sanity, I push ahead with what I can do, and I even find some time for entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary and I finished the last two episodes of the Netflix hit, “Bridgerton,” and we were both sad to see the end. If you haven’t watched, give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;episode or two. I am guessing that its magic will win you over.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, on the home front, since I mentioned it last week, my brother is off the ventilator, much better, thank you! And yet, he was many more struggles ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Something to ponder: That the Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration is in a day has not escaped me. I will miss the annual NAACP breakfast at Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Toward that end, I recommend a podcast, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/remembering-john-lewis/id150892556?i=1000485871039" target="_blank">“On Being,” featuring an interview with the late John Lewis</a>. He talks about MLK’s “beloved community” and some of the hard work, the intentional work that went into the civil rights movement, so mightily tempered by non-violent struggle and its democratic spirit.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are few short videos featuring Lewis, MLK Jr., and the Civil Right movement:&nbsp;</p>
