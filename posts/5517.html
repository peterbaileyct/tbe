<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central softball squad made it three-in-a-row on Thursday afternoon with a 10-3 victory over Wethersfield in a CCC Interdivisional showdown in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And everyone got into the action for the Rams, now 9-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gwen Torreso had a fantastic day at the dish, going 2-for-2 with a homer, a double, two runs scored and three RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Sklenka led things off with a base hit and scored a run while the Rams had a big three-run fourth to keep the Eagles at bay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Bartell - who went 2-of-3 from the plate with two RBI and a run scored - led off the fourth with a single and Kayla St. Onge sacrificed her over.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then came the home run and Central was off and running.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Adding hits to today’s offensive attack were Lorelei Stancavage, Kaley Laird, and Sophia Torreso,” said Central coach Monica Hayes via Twitter. “[The] defense was fantastic all day, highlighted by 5-6-3 inning-ending [double play].”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since losing a 2-1 decision to Bristol Eastern on May 6, Central has outscored opponents 22-6 and is on a bit of a roll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams aren’t done with the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is in action on Friday in Meriden as the Rams tangle with Maloney in a CCC South tilt from the Dunn Sports complex.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Hayes also noted that a few of her players were inducted into the National Honor Society that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Most importantly, Gabby Buonafede, Ryleigh Hall, and Sarah Romano were inducted into NHS tonight, joining a number of seniors who already are members,” said Hayes. “Congratulations to Gabby, Ryleigh, and Sarah!”</p>
