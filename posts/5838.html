<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decision time is looming for Victor Rosa as the standout athlete from Bristol Central will have his collegiate football future locked up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The quarterback, running back, and everything else he does athletically is ready to take his talents to the next level at the completion of his senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa is considered an athlete (ATH) in terms of offensive position in football and it’s the perfect description for the crafty competitor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s versatile enough to play multiple positions on offense and in multiple offensive packages, Rosa could be lined up in a different spot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s what helps make him an intriguing NCAA Division I prospect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa can play safety and defensive back on the flip side and perhaps that’s where his collegiate future will come to pass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is the complete package most collegiate programs are craving for, carrying an outstanding 4.3 GPA in the classroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there’s the 4.4 second 40 yard dash time that makes the six foot, 193 pound speed demon lethal on the gridiron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that highly anticipated decision will be made within the coming weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My goal is to make my final college decision by June 24th,” said Rosa via Twitter on Friday. “Excited to learn about all the amazing universities that I will be blessed to experience. This decision is a very serious one and my family’s opinion means a lot to me since they got me to this point.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coaches have noted that Rosa has the speed, technique, hands, size and, most importantly, the grades to make a tremendous impact on the collegiate level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa made an unofficial visit to UCONN on June 2 as he attempts to make a final decision on his collegiate future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can bet UCONN head coach Randy Edsall would love to keep the ultra-talented Rosa in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But UCONN is just one of many programs itching for Rosa’s services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has suitors everywhere and it’s going to be a big decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, where will Rosa end up playing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does the University of Maine make the ultimate cut?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about Boston College? ACC Football is on the rise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Air Force Academy is in the mix as Rosa could make a career in serving his country after his gridiron days are over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fordham has shown interest in Rosa as well as Dartmouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other offers have rolled in from West Point, the United State Naval Academy, and even Columbia University - an Ivy League school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those are all intriguing programs that he could sign with but UCONN gave Rosa his first NCAA Division I offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is the first offer the one Rosa will ultimately be going with?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll all find out soon enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa will be heading to various football camps this summer before going back to Central in the fall to begin his senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, like every one else, Rosa will be itching to play a little 11v11 football once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget his outstanding numbers from Bristol Central as a sophomore as he was one of the top players in the state from his class that year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made 177 carries for 1146 yards and 19 TD’s while at quarterback, Rosa was 31-of-79 for 475 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his last 11v11 scholastic game to date, Rosa helped his program retain the bell on Thanksgiving 2019 as Central defeated Bristol Eastern, 34-32 in overtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That day, Rosa made 31 carries for 171 yards while compiling five touchdowns. He also made two passes for 33 yards as he combined for over 200 yards.&nbsp;</p>
