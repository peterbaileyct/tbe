<p>BRISTOL - When the Bristol Central and Middletown boys track and field teams come together for a CCC South encounter, the meet is always an ultra-competitive bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, the meet usually comes down to the final events before a victor can be declared and this time around, Middletown narrowly escaped with the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons ended up stopping the Rams in a close 77-73 final from the turf track at Bristol Central this past Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was extremely successful on the track while Middletown excelled in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home squad nabbed all three relay sprints with several athletes earning multiple victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x800 relay, the combination of Austin Freve, Chris Roy, Noah Morrison, and Nate DeAngelo took the win in 8:44.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x100 relay, the team of Trey Jones, Jarrett Boxley, Xavier Browne, and Victor Rosa finished first in 44.7 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, in the 4x400 relay, Freve, Frankie Porrini, Rosa, and Noah Conrod led the charge, finishing in first place with a time of 3:39.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams on the track, Boxley dominated in both hurdle challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He won the 110 hurdles in 16.32 seconds and then in the 300, Boxley was at it again with the result the same in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, he seized the race in 44.7 seconds to claim both hurdle events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa, the Bristol Central star quarterback and member of the school’s undefeated boys basketball team this year, was a blur in motion during the 100 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa ended up winning the sprint in 10.93 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the duo of DeAngelo and Porrini dominated in the 800, 1600 and 3200-meter races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the mile challenge, DeAngelo had a day - finishing with a blazing time of 4:26.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 800 meters, Porrini nabbed the winning mark in 2:03.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 3200-meter race saw DeAngelo win once again, taking the two-mile event in 9:48.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Porrini was able to score a win for the Rams in the field as he made the winning leap in the high jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini’s winning mark came at five feet, ten inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s next meet takes place next Tuesday as the Rams travel to Maloney for a CCC South tilt in Meriden.</p>
