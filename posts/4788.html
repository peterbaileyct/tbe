<p>The regular season in scholastic hoop is about to conclude and the squads from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern are looking for a strong finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, the CCC Tournament begins for all the teams in the league and despite all the grumblings about the make-up of the postseason, there will be some big games on the horizon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has two games to play, including a home date against Lewis Mills on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are also in action twice this week with two showdowns on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a busy time for our scholastic warriors and here’s a special look at how the week opens for our public programs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Girls Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central (1-9) at New Britain (4-6)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>Monday, March 15 (5:30 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location: </strong>New Britain high school</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since beating Lewis Mills near the tail-end of February, the Central program has been competitive but dropped its fifth straight game last week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forward Janessa Bartell has been outstanding in defeat, posting 18.0 points-per-game over Central’s last two contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s never afraid to shoot the ball and has been the offensive force recently, driving the squad on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ella Watson posted 7.0 ppg over that same stretch but the Rams have yet to post a full 32-minute effort this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This team simply needs to get Brooke Watson, Gwen and Sophia Torreso rolling offensively and sees what happens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s going to be tough against the Hurricanes who will send out the talented Maya Slisz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s capable of a 25-point performance on any given night and that’s the first player Central must contain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Layla Mejia is another tough outside shooter who can also fill it up for New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a winnable contest for the locals and it just takes one victory to get the week rolling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Later This Week…</strong>The Rams end the regular season on Thursday against Lewis Mills (5:30 p.m.). Central’s one win this season came versus the Spartans back on February 26 (31-20).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (8-2) at Lewis Mills (1-9)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>Monday, March 15 (5:30 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location: </strong>The Thunderdome at Lewis Mills high school, Burlington</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This could be a milestone week for a certain member of the Bristol Eastern program but more on that topic another time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is still trying to get into that top-eight CCC Tournament bracket with the winner named the champion of the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into the contest against Mills, the Lancers have won two in-a-row, five of its last six and certainly has enough momentum to win out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that starts with the outstanding play from junior Ciara Collins (23.9 points, 8.4 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.6 blocks, 2.3 steals-per-game) whose production is All-State caliber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Truly, I’m not sure what the Spartans have to slow her down but the last time the teams met, Mills was extra physical going up against the all-around talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s going to be tough to duplicate, especially with Collins firing away from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s plenty of weapons around Collins with Alyssa Kehler (7.2 ppg, 5.3 rpg), Sage Scarritt (6.9 ppg, 8.3 rpg), Cali Doyon (7.3 ppg, 3.3 apg, 2.8 steals-per-game), Janessa Gonzalez (6.7 ppg, 5.5 rpg) Emma Stavens (4.0 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.2 apg) and Audrey Tice (1.6 rpg) contributing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans need to keep the turnovers to a minimum but if the Lancers start scoring in transition, it’s going to a long game for the home team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills has lost six straight games and its only victory came in a home triumph against Avon back on February 20 by a 43-22 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Thunderdome is a tough place to play but Mills has dropped it last three home games to Central (31-20), Southington (59-16) and New Britain (49-37) last Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How are the Spartans going to pull this one off against the Lancers?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Later This Week…</strong>The Lancers end up finishing things at New Britain high school at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday.</p>
