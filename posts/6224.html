<p>Our trek through the seasons of the Bristol Merchants in the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League continues today in TPE as a new coach takes over the second-year program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bunty Ray was named coach in 2002 and he knew exactly what the young squad needed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He attended Bristol Eastern High School and played baseball for coach Mike Giovinazzo.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the summers between Bristol Eastern and his first year of college, Ray played four years of Bristol American Legion Baseball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray helped the squad win the 1994 Connecticut State Championship which included a long postseason run in the Northeast Regional from West Warick, Rhode Island.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Bristol Eastern, Ray played collegiately under coach Bill Holowaty at Eastern Connecticut State University, helping the NCAA Division III program win the World Series in 1998.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in terms of coaching baseball, Ray has vast amounts of experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was an assistant coach and eventually head coach at Bristol Central for a combined 20 years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before retiring from the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League in 2010, Ray was an eight-time All-Star and a three-time GHTBL Manager of the Year – including a recognition award for Manager of the Decade for his 230-plus wins as the manager of the Bristol Merchants during the 2000s.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ray makes a dramatic turnaround</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former East Hartford Jets’ player made an immediate impact for Bristol, leading the Merchants to at least 21 wins a year over his nine seasons as coach – initially taking charge of the program to start the 74th season of GHTBL action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Ray brought in some reinforcements, outstanding and talented people Ray played with and against over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants added the likes of Adam Peters, Kevin Kalmin, Brian Archibald, Chris Strahowski, Chad McCann, and Nate Gawitt – among others – and the program immediately became ultra-competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only real negative was that the franchise still did not have a major sponsor in 2002.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other than that, Bristol had a quality team forming within its city limits that could hang with the best squads in the league before becoming one of the top GHTBL programs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even with Ray at the helm, Ed Smith was still Bristol’s General Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the season commenced, Ray mentioned that 96-percent of his players were from Bristol as only two players on the squad weren’t from the Mum City. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How good was that 2002 Bristol team?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray expected a huge improvement from season one to season two by the Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He wanted to produce at least a .500 regular season and each year, the goal was the win the GHTBL postseason tournament championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Ray knew his squad was going to be more than just competitive in league play and that all started for the squad in 2002.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Name Change?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A name change was always in the cards for the Merchants, but that one sponsor never materialized to take that next step.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until its final game in 2011, the Bristol outfit was always known as the Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the first couple years, Ray would ask for community contributions that would help with umpires, equipment, and field costs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And each time the program struggled due to finances, the outfit found a way to stay on the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ray of Sunshine</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray had played for a couple teams in the GHTBL before becoming the player/manager of the Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His baseball experience in coaching came as an assistant coach at Bristol Central under Tom Moylan while Ray also ran the Bristol Pony Leagues in town.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But how did Ray feel about playing for the GHTBL in the Mum City?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply put, Ray always says it was good to be home in Bristol - competing under the bright lights at Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The GHTBL in 2002</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2002, the new franchises in the GHTBL included Berlin and Farmington Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Newington Capitols did not return as the league lost one team but was up to nine squads overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each team played a total of thirty-two games - four contests against every squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six doubleheaders were scheduled from the Bristol home sites of Muzzy Field and Bristol Central. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, three games were slated for McCooey Field at BCHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, we will dive into the 2002 campaign as the Merchants were looking to storm the GHTBL under its new coach.&nbsp;</p>
