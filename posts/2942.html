<p>Plainville (3-0) beat Bristol Eastern (0-1-1) Tuesday afternoon, 1-0, behind a hustle goal by Michael Ouelette at 28:15 of the first half.&nbsp; Lancer goalie Nate Diloreto got a hand on Ouelette's shot, but it just made it into the corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eastern had many opportunities, especially in the second half, but shots were wide of the net&nbsp; or miskicked in front of the goal.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Lancer backs Luke Hammer, Adam Borry, Andrew Lozier, and Brandon Greger kept Plainville at bay, except for the one goal as Eastern controlled much of the play in the second half.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
