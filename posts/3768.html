<p>“A common trend is that vehicles are being left unoccupied and the keys (key fobs) being left in the vehicle; many of them with the engine running,” stated Chief Brian Gould. </p>

<p>Gould continued, “And here is a startling statistic - It was previously reported that in one weekend in August of 2020, 82 cars were reported stolen across Connecticut; 62 of which had key fobs left inside. Here in Bristol, out of the last 6 motor vehicles stolen; 5 of them were unoccupied, unlocked and left running.”<br></p>

<p>“This is usually a crime of opportunity,” said Chief Gould. “The majority of the time we are not investigating forced vehicle break-ins. Typically, vehicles are being left unlocked with valuables in plain site and/or the keys (key fobs) inside.”<br></p>
