<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The honors keep rolling in for one of the top scholastic boys basketball players in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means Bristol Central junior Donovan Clingan needs a little more space on his trophy shelf for yet another award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2021 Connecticut High School Coaches Association’s All-State Boys Basketball teams were released on Thursday, April 22 and the center from Bristol Central headed the Division II list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan, all 7-foot-1 and 265 pounds of him, dominated CCC, Region B play this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the division had several good players this year, the big man stood out as the top boys hoopster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past season, over a run that saw the Rams go a perfect 15-0, Clingan averaged a truly amazing double-double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Clingan dropped in 27.3 points and 17.2 rebounds-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add in 5.8 blocks and 3.1 assists-per-game, who else in the state of Connecticut boasted those kinds of numbers?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then add in the undefeated ledger and you have yourself the entire package.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won all the close games, wrapping up a 3-0 record in games that were decided by three points or less with victories over Avon (78-76), Plainville (64-61), and East Catholic (69-68) in overtime to decide the CCC Tournament champion in an epic confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The regular season was tremendous for Bristol Central and Clingan and while he averaged around 25.0 ppg over those 12 games, he elevated his play in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In three CCC tournament contests, Clingan roasted the competition for 108 points and 79 rebounds overall - good for 36.0 points and 26.3 rebounds-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who has ever tallied that kind of postseason scoring and rebounding from Central or any Bristol program for that matter?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As each postseason game rolled along, Clingan was more than ready for the challenge against the best the CCC had to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the top teams in the CCC were rolled by the Rams in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget, Windsor, Northwest and East Catholic were ranked in the top-four of the Connecticut state rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On March 22, Central started its quest for the CCC Tournament championship as the No. 5 seed - taking on fourth rated Windsor in a contest in which more than a few media outlets predicted would be won by the Warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that contest, the Rams led wire-to-wire, sinking Windsor by a 73-59 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan had one of his finest scholastic games, posting a career-high 39 points to go along with 26 rebounds and 10 blocks for an amazing postseason triple-double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two days later, in a showdown against No. 1 Northwest Catholic, it was more of the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan started the game by immediately draining two three-pointers on his way to 36 points and 27 rebounds against the third rated team in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, in a contest everyone was looking forward to, Central battled No. 2 East Catholic in the state’s biggest game of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Clingan popped off for 33 points, 26 rebounds, and five assists over another MVP performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up hitting the game-winning shot and helped his squad to the program’s first CCC Tournament title since 2003.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to that ending, Central finished ranked No. 1 in the state polls and the three-time All-CCC South selection proved to be the best player Connecticut had to offer in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once the scholastic season concluded, Clingan started his AAU season with Team Spartans out of Boston - a squad that’s loaded with talent from all over New England.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan has yet to decide his collegiate future and has nearly twenty Division I scholarship offers to mull over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, he wants one more crack at a scholastic season next year and hopes to bring Central a state title as he prepares for the next step in his basketball career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan also has a chance to become Bristol’s all-time leading scorer in scholastic history - boys or girls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Clingan was also named to GameTimeCT All-State Boys Basketball team, earning their MVP award in the process.</p>
