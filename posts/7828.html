<p>BRISTOL - After nabbing a 2-0 lead 24 minutes into its match against Lewis Mills on Thursday, the Bristol Eastern girls soccer squad just couldn’t hold on in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans scored three straight goals to take the game as Lewis Mills nabbed a 3-2 opening season victory over the Lancers from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the Spartans held Eastern scoreless over the final 56 minutes of the outing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But early on, the Kingstreeters showed offensive effort and ability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just 16 minutes into things, Ciara Collins found a charging Emily Nelson for a score as the Lancers secured a 1-0 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight minutes later, Bella Sanchez notched a goal on a misplayed ball by the opposing keeper as the Lancers grabbed a 2-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But from there, Eastern just ran out of gas as Mills got into the flow and scored three consecutive times to seize the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A tale of two halves,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “Eastern controlled most of the play in the first half but Lewis Mills dominated the second half.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riley Mills scored a goal with 11 minutes to go in the first half to chop the deficit to 2-1 and that score carried over into the second half of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with twenty minutes remaining in regulation, Maddy Hallet flipped in a goal to make it a 2-2 contest and then at the 74th minute of the contest, Riley Mills tallied the game-winning score as the Spartans wrapped up a 3-2 come-from-behind victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace D’Amato nabbed four saves for the Lancers while Mills outshot Eastern, 11-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn’t get any easier for Eastern next week as the Lancers are on the road for two straight matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers battle Berlin on Monday (6 p.m.) from Sage Park and then Eastern uses its entire fuel budget for the season on Friday as the locals travel up Interstate 84 to Edwin O. Smith high school in Storrs (3:45 p.m.) for a CCC Interdivisional bout.</p>
