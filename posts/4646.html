<p>For the second straight contest against a Bristol scholastic foe, the Lewis Mills boys basketball team did not allow the opponent to hit a 3-pointer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s pretty impressive considering the number of 3s that get chucked up in gymnasiums around the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem is that Bristol Central center, Donovan Clingan, didn’t need&nbsp; long-range bombs to help knockoff the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams eventually outscored Mills over all four quarters, moving to 5-0 on the season via a 59-37 victory from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol on Friday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans fell to 2-4 overall off the losing effort but proved difficult for the Rams to master throughout the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan ended the contest with a game-high 25 points, put together another double-figure rebounding total and rejected his quota of shots to pace Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams needed a little lift from the rest of the squad and a balanced scoring effort fueled the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sean Wininger contributed 11 points, Damion Glasper added nine, Carson Rivoira chipped in with eight while Victor Rosa was solid with six - putting together a season-high for points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nate DiChiara led the visitors with 14, Drew Cormier tallied 10 and Brice Waldron flipped in eight for the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills trailed 14-8 after eight minutes of work but stayed in it, down just 24-17 at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans eventually pushed forward to grab the lead, but by the completion of three periods, the team was down 14, trailing 41-27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a comeback was never in the cards as Central padded its lead and held on to defeat Lewis Mills, 59-37.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams have a quick turnaround as the program was back in action the following day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a make-up due to recent inclement weather, Central travels to Plainville on Saturday to square off against the Blue Devils in a CCC Region B tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils, after defeating Bristol Eastern on February 17 in overtime (60-56), lost to both Farmington and Avon this week and will attempt to avoid a three-game losing streak against Central from the Ivan Wood Gymnasium in Plainville.</p>
