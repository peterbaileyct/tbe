<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – From 1977 until 1983, the Bristol Central volleyball program didn’t have any success against its crosstown rival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The series was one-sided with just one five-set war and four, four-set games over that slew of matches – all going in Bristol Eastern’s favor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all that dominance, wasn’t it time for Central to have a little bit of on court success against Eastern?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunes changed for the Rams in 1984 as Central finally defeated Eastern via a 3-0 sweep behind set scores of 15-9, 15-6, and 15-7.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laura Fortier, Paula Roy, Tracie Blair, and Patricia Burk led the Central charge while Maureen O’Keefe played well for Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big moment for the program but to end the regular season, could the Rams pull off a consecutive victory against the Lancers?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was a sweep even possible?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would take some doing but Central was able to stave off Eastern over a five-set confrontation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scores were 13-15, 15-11, 15-13, 2-15, and 15-4.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beth Harris and Fortier helped lead the charge by Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The season sweep was impressive, the Rams ended the regular season at 12-6 – ranked No. 12 in the Class M tournament fray – while Eastern finished at .500 and qualified for the postseason in the final position at No. 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The qualification level for state tournament play in scholastic volleyball was a 9-9 ledger (.500) and that’s where Eastern finished in the regular season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what were the chances Central and Eastern would meet in the state tournament after Central finally shutout the Lancers?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That possibility came to fruition as the two squads from Bristol squared off for the third time in 1984 – this time in a Class M qualifying match.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what was the chance that Central could defeat Eastern for a third time in the same season?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>November 5 was the date, the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium at Bristol Central was the place but the higher seed could not earn the win in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams took the first set but Eastern won the other three, seizing a 3-1 victory behind scores of 7-15, 15-5, 15-10, and 15-10 in a tough and stunning loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anne Wisyanski, Lauren Mascola, Donyale Pina, Debbie Siemiatkoski, Stacy Mills, Jodi Plawecki and O’Keefe helped Eastern in the victorious effort against Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next day, Wethersfield foiled the Lancers in first round play but a chance for three straight wins for Central over Eastern did not happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in 1985, it was a strange year for the Lancers as the program split against the Rams and failed to qualify for the postseason under head coach Gail McMahon (Ericson).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern missed the state tournament just twice over her tenure as coach, the second time coming in 1994 when the Lancers duplicated the same 8-10 record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the rivalry in 1985 saw Central win the first showdown, downing Eastern 3-1 as the Rams won its third straight regular season match over the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 15-5, 10-15, 15-10, and 15-1 as Geri Ristow (13 kills), Amy Gibson, and Tracie Blair nearly collected a combined three dozen service points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jen Godin also dropped in 10 service points to lead the winners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the rematch, Eastern had to defeat Central, Bulkeley and Farmington to qualify for state tournament play as the squad entered the tilt against the Rams with a 7-9 record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers accomplished part one of their task in another thrilling five set battle, defeating the Rams, 3-2 (13-15, 15-7, 15-6, 10-15, and 15-7).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Ferrier, Wisyanski, Mills, Pina, and Siemiatkoski all had a hand in the must-win showdown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern then defeated Bulkeley the following day (15-3, 15-12, and 16-14) as the Lancers won five out of its last six matches to get on the doorstep of state tournament qualification.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Farmington match became a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers fell in five sets, 3-2, ended the season at 8-10 and were out of the state tournament picture for the first time since 1981.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led the battle against the Indians but lost in the end by scores of 8-15, 15-9, 6-15, 15-10, and 15-9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match was played under protest as the start time was in question but nothing came of it and the ultimate result stood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, 1985 was quickly forgotten about as Eastern went on to play in two consecutive state title games, winning it all in 1987 against a powerful Platt squad from Meriden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mum City squads swapped wins in 1986 as Eastern swept Central over its first encounter by scores of 15-8, 15-11, and 15-11 behind superior play from Lauren Ferrier, Kathy Ferrier, Cheryl Kaczmarczyk, Laura Forman, and Wisyanski before the Rams pulled off an upset in the rematch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Led by Amy Gibson and Tracie Blair, Central hung a four-game loss on Eastern (15-12, 15-9, 11-15, and 15-10) to even the season series at 1-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kathy Ferrier and Mills played well for Eastern (14-4) in defeat but that victory was going to be the last for quite some time for Central over its city rival.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Rams weren’t going to beat the Kingstreeters at all over the next six years – spanning another championship run by Eastern in 1991.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the postseason of 1986, the Lancers were the sixth ranked team, Central was rated No. 11 and guess what?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams battled once again in state tournament play – turning the bout into a rubber match of sorts between the schools.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first-round tilt, Eastern defeated Central, 3-1, from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium at Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers won by scores of 15-2, 0-15, 15-4, and 15-9 – surviving a second period drought that saw the program fail to tally a point.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kathy Ferrier, Wisyanski, Adams, Mills, Forman, and Kaczmarczyk all led the charge for the victors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern later advanced to the finals of the Class M championship but was swept by Platt, 3-0 (15-6, 15-10, and 15-9).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in 1987, Eastern earned its first state championship in a rematch against those same Panthers, seizing the title by scores of 15-9, 11-15, 15-11, and 15-7 from Kennedy high school in Waterbury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
