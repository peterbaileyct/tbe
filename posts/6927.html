<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol American Legion baseball coach Jerry LaPenta knew that his squad was going to play in a 2-1 game sometime during the postseason this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while LaPenta should immediately buy as many lottery tickets as he possibly can because that score came to pass on Wednesday night as No. 3 Bristol defeated No. 11 Tri-Town by a 2-1 final from Muzzy Field on Wednesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory set-up a showdown against No. 7 Avon, a 9-3 upset winner over No. 2 RCP, as the Northern portion of the tournament moves to Rotary Field in South Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time on Thursday is 4 p.m. -- the first of two contests that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol moved to 19-6 overall while Tri-Town finished at 15-15-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two huge double plays erased multiple Tri-Town runners that night while Bristol got the job down despite just three hits, a far cry from the 14 Post 2 generated the previous day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was kind of the opposite of last night,” said LaPenta. “I’ve been around the game a long time and I know when you knockout 14 hits…sometimes when that happens, the next day, they don’t come as easy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Roberto Cruz (6.2 IP, 7 hits, 7 K, 0 ER) was outstanding while Matt Beaucar saved the game for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tri-Town opened play as Hamilton Barnes singled to left and Brayden Akana walked to put two on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was tomfoolery on the bath paths for Tri-Town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason Barber smoked a single to left and Barnes attempted to score from third -- testing Trevor Nohilly’s arm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nohilly gunned down the runner as catcher Owen Davis tagged Barnes out at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the play, Tri-Town was then in the midst of a reverse "Bristol Pickle" and paid the price in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barber was stuck in-between first and second base, with Akana watching from third, and was eventually tagged out by Andrew Lozier for a slick double-play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That double play was huge,” said LaPenta. “Basically, that’s the game. I was shocked that [Tri-Town’s coach] sent [Barnes] with [what would have been] the bases loaded and [the fourth batter] up. [Their coach] sends [Barnes], Trevor made a great throw and [Barber], I don’t know where he was going. Lozier made a great play, looked at the guy at third, ran back [Barber], got the double play and that took a lot of life out of them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s a killer when you don’t score after that."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when John Merrill struck out, Tri-Town had two singles and a walk and came away empty on the scoreboard in the top of the first frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol then got its first two batters on as Austin Brown walked and Adam Caron beat out a fielder’s choice to third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier then looped a single to short left, scoring Brown, to make it a 1-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think after we got out of that jam, we had all the momentum,” said LaPenta. “Austin does a great job, works a walk. He beats the [Caron] ground ball. That’s huge speed and then Lozier gets a little off the end of the bat [and] we get a run there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz then went 1-2-3 in the second, fanning Riley O’Brien to finish off the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Roberto really settled down after [the first inning] and pitched great,” said LaPenta. “He’s pitched great all year for us.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Zack Rinkavage posted a two-out walk in the bottom of the second -- advancing on a wild pitch to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Nohilly drew strike three as the 1-0 game went into the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Their pitcher threw great,” said LaPenta of Barber. “He had a good arm, he settled in, and in the fifth and sixth inning, I was taking a few more pitches just tying to get his pitch count up to get him out. Then they brought in another guy [Merrill] who threw just as hard. They are a nice club.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tri-Town’s Alex Grauer slipped a hit by Evan Bouchard at shortstop for a one-out base hit in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamilton followed suit with a single to left and the visitors had two on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone, a wild pitch advanced the duo but Barber fell via strikes as Bristol’s 1-0 push was holding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown greeted Barber with a single to open the third that was just out of reach of the shortstop and a wild pitch advanced to runner to second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron grounded out at third base, but off the throw, Brown took third, sliding in safely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on a grounder to third by Lozier, Brown was caught in a rundown going to home plate as the third baseman was in chase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But off the throw to the catcher, the ball was dropped on the tag as Brown was safe at the dish -- making it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The kid playing third…he made a mistake,” said LaPenta of Tri-Town. “You just throw the ball to home and get the rundown going the other way. If something gets screw up, he’s safe [at third and not at home]. That’s the difference in the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Merrill started the fourth with a grounder to third, but the throw to the bag was off -- allowing the runner to seize second base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cameron L’Heureux then earned a walk as Tri-Town had runners on first and second with no outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a single to center by Eric Matthewson, Merrill scored to cut the deficit to 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sacrifice bunt from Riley O’Brien advanced both runners into scoring position with one gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Riley Sargent lined out to short right, and with Mathewson nearly at third base, he could not get back to second in time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown got the ball into second base, and the runner was doubled-up to end the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bouchard drew a one-out walk in the bottom of the fourth, and Nohilly added a base-on-balls to put two on with two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Brown struck out -- Barber’s seventh K of the evening -- as Bristol’s 2-1 edge was holding pat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Akana etched up a two-out hit up the middle in the fifth but nothing came of it as Cruz had settled down nicely through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the bottom of the fifth, Caron drew a walk on eight pitches then moved to second on a passed ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barber fanned Fradette for his eighth strikeout, but another passed ball saw Caron move over to third base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a tremendous catch by O’Brien at first base -- nabbing a Kozikowski pop-up in foul territory -- Barber was out of the inning, and out of pitches via the pitch count rule, as the sixth frame commenced with Bristol still in front by a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz showed some gumption in the sixth, striking out L’Heureux and Matthewson, to keep it a 2-1 contest as Merrill came into pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rinkavage flipped in a single to left with two outs in the sixth, but after one final fly-out, Tri-Town was down to its final at-bats with Cruz returning to the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>O’Brien popped out to Caron in foul territory for the first out, and Cruz struck out Sargent for his seventh K as Beaucar came in for the final out. Grauer then sent a double to the gap in left center to put the tying on, but Barnes grounded out to Rinkavage at third to end the game with Bristol a 2-1 winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re on a good roll,” said LaPenta. “[But] it’s not going to get any easier Thursday [against Avon].”&nbsp;</p>
