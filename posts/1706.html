<p>This "10 Minutes" podcast features Lindsay Vigue of Lindsay Vigue Photography and chair of the City Arts and Culture Commission. Lindsay and her spouse, Jessica, decided to get to know their neighbors after the Coronavirus pandemic forced everyone indoors. Through a series of creative initiatives, it appears the neighborhood and the people who live there have become more neighborly and closer. Lindsay and Jessica document the activities on a private Facebook page, Northeast Neighbors Connect. Together they write and contribute to <a href="http://www.thegypsywives.com">The Gypsy Wives blog</a>.</p>
