<p>BRISTOL - With the upcoming CCC Tournament fast approaching, the Bristol Central girls basketball team was looking to pick up a little momentum for it on Thursday night with a win over scrappy Lewis Mills.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams earned that victory, sinking the visitors by a 41-34 final from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The triumph for the Rams (2-10) completed a sweep of the Spartans (1-11) this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a huge conquest for Central as the win broke a six-game losing streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mill was only able to average 27.0 points-per-game against Central this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two players for the Rams were able to notch a double-figure point total by the completion of the showdown against the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Bartell and Ella Watson each tallied 11 points, Sophia Torreso added seven while Gwen Torreso notched four to help topple Lewis Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watson also added three 3-pointers to the effort, Brooke Watson scored eight points while Damani Hough also played well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brianna Pelchar led the Spartans with 11 points while Abby Jankoski scored 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was close throughout as Central led 14-13 through eight minutes of action and at the half, the home team snared a 22-21 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teamâ€™s combined for just five total points over the third frame of play but entering the final period of action, the Rams were in charge by a 25-23 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central was able to make all the tough plays late, scooping up 16 points in the fourth, as the Rams won its second game of the season behind the 41-34 victory.</p>
