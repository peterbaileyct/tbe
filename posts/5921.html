<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a sports reporter from a leading newspaper (BP) once asked what town the McCabe-Waters Pirates were from at the conclusion of a&nbsp;<em>Bristol</em>&nbsp;Little League Baseball City Series game on August 17, 2015, a little whippersnapper from the winning squad had the answer of all answers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Toronto!” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That quote came from a young man by the name of Andrew Lozier as he had just pitched his Pirates to a 9-3 victory against the Edgewood A’s.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was about six years before Lozier’s senior season at Bristol Eastern and it was that wit – along with a boatload of ability – that made the outstanding all-around athlete a star on the diamond for the Lancers this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just last week, Lozier was named to the&nbsp;2021 Class L CHSCA All-State Baseball Team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tremendous and well-deserved honor for the senior standout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Andrew making the all-state team is so deserving,” said Eastern coach Steve Gaudet.&nbsp;“He worked so hard the past two years to make himself into an all-state hitter. Andrew led the team in average, hits, RBI's and home runs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier, the heart and soul of the Eastern team, helped orchestrate an amazing comeback this season after a tough 0-7 start by the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was one of the few athletes on the squad who played varsity ball in 2019 – under then coach Mike Giovinazzo – and simply exploded out of the gate from the plate as a senior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as the regular season concluded in May, it was his pitching that helped Eastern get to the pay window over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a guy every team craves as his enthusiasm is infectious and he simply won’t quit until the final out has been recorded.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier’s batting average nearly reached .400 for the season while he drilled five of Eastern’s six home runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the senior batted .396 which included 11 hits for extra bases – making himself an easy pick for All-State honors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels good,” said Lozier of the honor. “I worked hard all winter. It was a grind all winter and it was my goal [to earn All-State] from the beginning. It’s nice to finally nice to be where I wanted to be.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier was absolutely on fire to start the season at the plate, going 17-of-32 for a sweet .531 average over his first 12 games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He padded his stats with three doubles, three triples, and those five home runs – all team-leading totals at Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact,&nbsp;Lozier accounted for over 42-percent of his squad’s extra-base hits in 2021. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His on-base percentage of .568 was augmented by 20 walks while he collected 21 hits and 23 RBI, leading the squad in all those categories.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also added four sacrifice flies and four stolen bases over a very busy campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier also dominated on the mound and late in the season, he was extremely tough to get a hit off. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He also led the team in wins on the mound,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“He pitched four complete games to finish out the year, and won three of them, and the one loss was in the state tournament where he only gave up two hits [at Woodstock].”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an 0-2 start to the season, Lozier muscled his way to three straight victories from the hill as he quickly began piling up complete game efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 3-3 overall with a 4.17 ERA – well below the team average this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier pitched over 40 innings this year, allowing just 24 earned runs while fanning 23.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of the 43 hits he allowed, only six went for extra bases as he made all the big pitches for his squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier was a defensive standout at shortstop and when he had to pitch, he was one of the top fielding pitchers in all the Central Connecticut Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was the leadership aspect that he brought to every game, whether it was on the diamond or at the dish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He commanded respect from teammates and opponents alike and when the pressure was at its highest and there were ducks on the pond, Lozier was the man Eastern turned to – whether he was playing in Bristol…or Toronto. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Andrew was the leader of this team on and off the field, and he was such a great player to work with in my first season as head coach,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“We all will miss Andrew next year.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pitching&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*To wrap up the season, in a complete game gem against No. 4 Woodstock, Lozier allowed the Centaurs just two hits to go along with four Ks but Eastern fell by a 3-1 push in first round CIAC Class L play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
