<p>When St. Paul Catholic boys basketball standout Tommy Lorenzetti wrapped up his stellar scholastic career last Wednesday, the senior put together a great year despite business not being as usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the guard isn’t done competing because once graduation rolls around, he’ll be hitting the hardwood on the collegiate scene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti is still in the process of deciding where to get his education and play a little hoop but the shortened 2021 campaign gave prospective programs plenty of positives to see.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior has a presence on Twitter as a member of the Connecticut Passion AAU basketball program and while his play on the floor speaks volumes to what a collegiate squad will get with Lorenzetti as a member of its team, one tweet spelled out four intangible qualities that absolutely describes the talented player:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tough, unselfish, coachable and determined.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s plenty more positives when speaking about Lorenzetti - on and off the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s an outstanding player, great student and an even better young man,” according to an earlier tweet from the Connecticut Passion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about his 3.5 GPA because balance is everything in life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between class and basketball, he had a full plate over the past two months, balancing it extremely well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s just a sampling of Lorenzetti’s highlights over a very busy Naugatuck Valley League slate:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>February 20: </strong>Lorenzetti scooped up 13 points as St. Paul Catholic upset fifth ranked Naugatuck by a 70-63 final from Bristol, helping the program win its first game of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>February 23: </strong>The senior guard dropped in 16 points to push the Falcons past Watertown, 49-41, for the program’s first road victory of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>February 24: </strong>After sinking Watertown, Lorenzetti scored another 16 points as St. Paul Catholic downed Torrington, 63-50, as the Falcons moved to 3-1 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>February 26: </strong>Lorenzetti upped the ante in a home game against Wolcott, flipping in 19 points, as the Falcons were 61-45 winners in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>March 3: </strong>In a tough 63-49 loss to Naugatuck, Lorenzetti showed his long-range skills, draining four three-pointers, tallying 14 points, dishing out four assists and nabbing two steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>March 5: </strong>Lorenzetti and the Falcons bounced back from the loss to Naugy as the locals swept the season-series from Watertown, winning the second game by a 72-60 final. The senior collected 15 points, hitting another four three-pointers, and dishing out five assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>March 9</strong>: Kicking in a then career-high 24 points, connecting on four 3s once again, Lorenzetti and St. Paul Catholic were 57-50 winners over Torrington. The talented senior filled the stat sheet with five rebounds, five assists and two steals over another complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>March 17: </strong>In a showdown against Crosby, Lorenzetti hit for another career-high, this time posting 26 points while also dishing out six assists, as the Falcons won by a 69-61 final. He netted another four three-pointers while scooping in three steals as St. Paul Catholic moved to 9-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>March 20: </strong>Lorenzetti had another balanced effort with seven points, five rebounds, four assists while rejecting two shots as St. Paul Catholic defeated Torrington for the third time this season, 56-46, as the squad from Bristol was off and running in the first round of the NVL tournament. The team made it to the semifinal round, falling to Naugatuck 61-39 on March 24 to end the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For his efforts this year, Lorenzetti made the All-Iron Division team, working extremely hard over an excellent senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He averaged about 13 points-per-game and displayed an overall floor-game that helped make St. Paul Catholic very successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons were 9-2 during regular season play, the top team in the NVL’s Iron division and ranked second in the 2021 NVL Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti and St. Paul Catholic went 11-3 overall in 2021, finishing 2-1 over postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting to the semifinals of the NVL Tournament was a testament his playing ability and his leadership as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether its Elms College, the University of New England, Albany College of Pharmacy or Wentworth Institute of Technology, Lorenzetti is going to find the perfect landing spot to get his education and launch a three-pointer (or four).</p>
