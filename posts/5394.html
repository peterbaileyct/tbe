<p>SOUTHINGTON - The Bristol Eastern girls tennis squad has taken on some of the top programs of the Central Connecticut Conference over its last two matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the results haven’t exactly gone in the Kingstreeters favor, the team has continued to push, keeps fighting, and those battles are eventually going to have some sort of pay off.</p>

<p>Eastern went up against a tough squad from Southington on Monday afternoon, falling by a 7-0 final from the tennis courts at Southington High School.</p>
