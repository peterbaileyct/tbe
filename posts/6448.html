<p>TBE continues its look at the Bristol Merchants of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball and this week, the 2003 squad is under the microscope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the third consecutive season of Merchants’ baseball in the GHTBL and the team had more than a couple studs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pitching staff included Plainville’s Scott Martin, Jerry Hasler, Chris Strahowski, Jarrett Stawarz, Brian Archibald - all former Independent League Baseball players - along with Adam Platt, Eric Baim, and Aaron Seibert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Hackney brothers (Jeff and Matt) also played for the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other additions included Lance Lamboley (Avery Point) and Josh Coleman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cory Parker did not play for the Merchants in 2003 and his bat was sorely missed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, head coach Bunty Ray, Adam Peters, Ryan Smith, Nate Gawitt, Kevin Kalmin, Chris Sawyer, and crew returned for another season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GHTBL was celebrating its 75th year of operation in 2003 with each team playing a 32-game slate with the double-elimination postseason tournament that followed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Muzzy Field was the home for most of the Merchants’ games and the program had many highlights over the summer of 2003.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fun started on Saturday, May 31 as Bristol spun Meriden by a 10-6 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strahowski won over a four-inning showing while Martin threw two relief frames in the Merchants’ opener.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Peters had a two-run homer while Smith and Lamboley added RBI singles to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A four-run fourth by the Merchants ended the showdown while Gawitt, Matt Hackney, Smith, and Ray had two hits apiece for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on June 10, Martin (6.1 innings, four hits, four K’s, 1-0 record) won the contest for the Merchants over Mr. G’s, 4-3 - moving to 3-1 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aaron Seibert threw two scoreless innings to earn the save against Mr. G’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Hackney added a two-run homer while Kalmin also blasted a home run for the Merchants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray tallied a hit and a stolen base for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, locked in a 2-2 stalemate on June 24, Bristol notched four runs in the sixth inning and two more in the seventh as the Merchants defeated Mr. G’s, 8-3, in South Windsor to break a bit of a losing streak (7-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mullins went 3-of-4 while Sawyer rambled up a 2-for-4 effort with a home run and a double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kalmin (two RBI) also doubled, and Martin won the game on the hill, giving up eight hits to send the defending regular season champs packing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then to end the month of June, Hasler allowed seven hits and struck out five lead Bristol to a 7-3 win over Mr. G’s from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw a complete game to help the Merchants break a three-game slide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mullins and Sawyer each tallied three hits to make it a 6-0 contest through four innings of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the second game, it was more of the same as Bristol defeated Mr. G’s, 6-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray (three hits) and Peters (two hits) smashed home runs while Archibald (seven hits) went the distance on the mound over the four-run victory as the Merchants moved to 9-7 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two weeks later, Sawyer dropped in a three-run home run as the Orioles from Vernon were shutout at home by the Merchants, 5-0, on July 13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin struck out five over five innings of work while adding a double and two RBI to his tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strahowski threw two innings of scoreless relief for Bristol as the squad won four out of its past six games as both teams moved to 11-9 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After three straight loses, Bristol got back to the pay window as</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin rallied up two hits and two RBI to pace Bristol in Hartford, 4-2, as the Merchants got back to .500 for the season (12-12).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first of eight straight victories by the Merchants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday, July 26, Gawitt drilled a home run while Pat Holden was 3-for-4 to lead Bristol in a huge 11-run win over Sakon Biz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final was 13-2 from Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a doubleheader rematch against Sakon. Biz from Muzzy Field on</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tuesday, July 29, the Merchants sweep the squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals roped up scores of 8-0 and 11-5 to move to 18-12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baim threw a five-hitter and Peters smashed out a three-run homer in game one while Sawyer also added a three-run homer, went 2-for-4 overall, and collected five RBI.</p>
