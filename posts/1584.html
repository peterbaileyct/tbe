<p>The Bristol Sports Hall of Fame has cancelled their annual Scholar-Athlete Dinner this year because of Covid 19. The dinner recognizes Juniors and Seniors from the three local high schools who have received at least three varsity letters and who have also maintained an academic average of 90 or better.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the dinner was cancelled, and school has been out for the month of April. the Hall of Fame has been unable as of now to get the Scholar-Athletes their award certificates and the small token they receive for their accomplishments.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hall of Fame also awards $1,500 scholarships to two students from each school at the dinner. Again, because of the social distancing requirements, the scholarship committee has been unable to meet as of yet to choose this year's scholarship winners. Hopefully, that can be accomplished in the near future.</p>

<p>If schools manage to re-open before the end of the year, it is hoped that the scholarship winners and the scholar-athletes can be recognized at a school assembly at each building. If schools remain closed, the Hall of Fame will get the award certificates and the scholarships out to the students by mail.</p>

<p>Bob Kalat, Hall of Fame president, announced that for the first time this year, the Hall of Fame has the benefit of generous donors to sponsor the scholarships at each school. </p>

At Bristol Eastern, the two scholarships will be awarded in the memory of Christopher Calnan. And at St. Paul Catholic High, the two scholarships will be awarded in the memory of the Roberge family.</p>
