<p>MERIDEN – The Bristol Eastern boys soccer team won its showdown at Platt on Friday by a 4-0 final in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, now 2-3, notched two goals in each half to knock off the Panthers (0-5) in a CCC South confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dom Femiak posted his third goal of the season to start Eastern’s scoring exploits, taking in a Justin Sanchez pass, beating a defender, and drilled a shot past Platt goalie Nicholas Link with 23:10 remaining in the first half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Tyler Borry added a goal off a free kick that was kicked perfectly into the upper far corner of the Platt net as the Lancers led 2-0 with 8:12 to play in the first period.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open second stanza of play, Femiak fed Eddie Ansah on a crossing pattern – flashing the ball into the Platt goal just 3:25 into things to make it a 3-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the scoring heroics for the Lancers, Oscar Twardy won a ball at the Platt 40 and pushed a through ball up to Rocco Barbino.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barbino dashed around two defenders and tucked in a shot at the near post as the Lancers secured a 4-0 push that was never challenged with 27:10 left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our defense stayed compact and our midfielders and forwards were active," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern keepers, Carlos Portillo and Peyton Cummings each made three saves while Link tallied eight for the Panthers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first shutout of the season by the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, Eastern is back at it with two matches as the locals host Maloney Tuesday evening at 6:30 from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on October 1, Edwin O. Smith comes to town for a CCC Interdivisional tilt against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 4 p.m. in Bristol.</p>
