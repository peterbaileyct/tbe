<p>Town and City Clerk, Therese Pac, recently announced a change in office hours for the clerk's office.  Beginning on October 1, the office will be open from 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM, Monday through Friday.  The change in hours will end on November 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main reasons for the change in hours are the extra duties the clerk's office must undertake for the 2020 elections.  Absentee ballots and other election priorities must be carried out to ensure a fair and orderly election.</p>

<p>Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu reminded the public that the Clerk's Office is providing services by appointment only, based on current safety measures in place due to the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>Members of the public are encouraged to review the Town/City Clerk’s webpage, email, or call the office with specific questions. The staff will then advise them of whether the information or transaction can be handled by phone, email, mail or if it requires a visit to the office.<br></p>
