<p>Come Sunday morning, I will have received a new right knee. The surgery was Friday, so I am guessing that I will be recovering, found a good friend in my recliner, and have a new companion in the ice machine that will help with reducing the swelling and pain from the procedure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We shall see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, TBE has started experimenting with a daily review, a digest of short articles about things that may have occurred that day somewhere in the city.&nbsp; It is a team effort, with contributors snapping photos and sending text to be incorporated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hope is that these little bits of information will provide our readers with a more complete picture of the city, oftentimes, parts that go unnoticed, like city meetings. In the end, the review may help historians piece together their own picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a break in the rain, Mary and I got out to a Blues game on Wednesday night. The Blues aren’t having that great of a year, but it is still good to see them play, to hear the names of colleges from across the country over the loudspeakers. It’s a big country, and we are all connected. This is another small way to remind ourselves of that connection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, we’ve got a bunch of local teams playing their way through the summer.&nbsp;From local Little League,&nbsp;to American Legion, to the Greeners, and now with the opening of Eastern Regional play, there is plenty of sports entertainment to get out of the house, safely, and enjoy a night out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with the vaccination numbers increasing, I am still leery of attending indoor activities, and much prefer the safer outdoor ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s why I am thinking that attending city meetings via Zoom or some other virtual platform is transformational. Agreed, nothing tops in-person attendance, because there is always something going on between an audience and those on the dais; however, virtual attendance allows for many more people to login and participate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is one takeaway from this coronavirus pandemic that may be a good one. I can think of a few others, such as, learning once again to appreciate time, time to sink into issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week’s reading assign is Heather McGhee’s <em>The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together</em>. It is clearly written, thoughtful, open-minded and instructive. There are plenty of stories about real people, and while you don’t have to read them, pages of footnotes to verify sources. </p>

<p>I guess racism was the theme this week. I discovered a new podcast, this one by&nbsp;Ibram&nbsp;X. Kendi, who wrote Stamped: from the Beginning and How to be Anti-Racist. The podcast is Be Antiracist. It can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/be-antiracist-with-ibram-x-kendi/id1564144316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
