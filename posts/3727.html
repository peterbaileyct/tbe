<p>I know many of you are suffering from Covid Isolation Dementia (CID), just as my wife and I are. (Although, in my case, it's remotely possible that age is involved.)</p>

<p>Well, after you have finished binging The Crown, all seven seasons of The West Wing, and all 63 seasons of NCIS, it might be a great idea to clear your mind and go for a walk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I have a great place for you to visit.  Rockwell Park's loop around the pond is a perfect, easy, scenic beauty right now.  The Bristol Park Department has done a great job making the park so clean and pristine, and the snow cover now adds to the magic. </p>

<p>One loop around the park is about 3/4 of a mile, so two laps is a perfect workout in the snow. The walkway has been plowed on the side closest to the main entrance, and the other side is packed down pretty well by the thoughtful folks who were kind enough to get there before us. So it is an easy jaunt on one side, and an aerobic workout on the other. </p>

<p>Our dog Dusty (full name- Dustin Pedroia Krampitz) loves tugging us around the loop, stopping every ten yards or so for some secret canine messaging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The only hike she likes better than Rockwell is the Hoppers/Birges Pond area, where she can romp through the woods like her ancient ancestors. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Dusty has given Rockwell Park a rating of 4 Paws, which is very close to perfect. The only higher rating is the aforementioned Hoppers, which she has rated 4 Paws and a Tail, the highest rating a dog can bestow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of ratings, it only takes me 16 hours, 24 minutes, and 33 seconds to circle the path at Rockwell twice. My fitness tracker has rewarded me with a special rating for that accomplishment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is an unusual app with distinct rankings for all skill levels. For example, someone who could finish two laps at Rockwell in seven minutes or less would be ranked “Olympian.” My ranking is next to last on the list, “Prepare Your Obituary.”</p>

<p>No matter your ranking, Rockwell Park is a lovely place for a leisurely winter stroll.</p>
