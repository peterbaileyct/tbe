<p>The year is simply going to be forgettable due to the fact that there will not be a Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern football clash on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reality is that COVID-19 has foiled the annual Battle for the Bell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game has been postponed before but never outright cancelled until this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was more fun than waking up on Thursday morning with the anticipation of an exciting  scholastic football matchup from Muzzy Field about to take place?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a frustrating year for all our gridiron athletes who were not allowed to compete in 11-on-11 football this fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, a spring season with a reduced schedule could still be in the works for those athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for now, we are left with some amazing Turkey Day memories from days gone by.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And we are not going to let this holiday season go by without running down a little BC/BE football nostalgia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next four days, check in with The Bristol Edition as we take a look back at all 61 battles between the public schools in town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our trip down memory lane will be broken up into divisional chunks: the Central Connecticut Interscholastic League years (1959-1973), the decade plus of Colonial Conference wars (1974-1983) and a two-part look at the Central/Eastern battles from the Central Connecticut Conference play (1984-present).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In part one, here are the highlights from the 15 confrontations under the CCIL banner when Eastern actually held the advantage over Central on Thanksgiving:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BC wins</strong>: 6</p>

<p><strong>1966 — Bristol Eastern, 20-13</strong> – In a rare feat on Thanksgiving Day play, Eastern took the series lead away from Central in the seven point win. It was all “done” by Mark Dunn (three touchdowns rushes of 76, 7 and 11 yards) as the Lancers won by a touchdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1967 — Bristol Central, 8-0</strong> – Central defeated Eastern behind Walt Kozikowski’s six-yard pass to Hal Herold with 59 seconds remaining in the contest as the Rams seized the win. It was Central’s first victory over Eastern since 1961.</p>

<p><strong>1972 — Bristol Central, 16-12</strong> – The Rams scooped up over 400 yards in total offense as the Lancers allowed Central two quick scores to ice the contest.

Eastern’s Tim McHugh nabbed 135 yards on 20 carries.</p>
