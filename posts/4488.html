<p>“The free program is sponsored from a grant through the United States Department of Agriculture and is being handled now through&nbsp;Foodshare.&nbsp;The boxes include meat products, vegetables, and dairy products like yogurt, cheese and milk.&nbsp;We reserve the right to limit boxes so we can have maximum households receive something. If you have multiple households in one car, we will try to accommodate people to the best of our ability,”&nbsp;said Donna Osuch, President of the United Way.</p>

<p>“During the pandemic, we have realized that Food Insecurity is a community issue, and we are very excited that this program is back for 2021,”&nbsp;said Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu.&nbsp;“The boxes are large, so we also encourage people to share with a neighbor or family members&nbsp;to ensure nothing goes to waste.”</p>
