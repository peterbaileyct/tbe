<p>The Bristol Edition asked Mayor Jeff Caggiano if he had any knowledge or comment on Sklenka’s resignation. Caggiano replied that he could not comment directly because it is a board matter. He did say that he would consult with Jen Dube, chair, in regard to naming Sklenka’s successor. </p>

<p>The mayor and city council have 35 days to confirm a replacement as per the city charter. The replacement will serve out the remainder of Sklenka’s term. The mayor also pointed out that Dube and Kristen Giantonio, the vice-chair of the board, first joined the board as appointees.</p>
