<p>PLAINVILLE - There’s a couple sides to the Plainville girls basketball team and both are equally as successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first side is a team-balanced concept that sees more that a couple players notch double-figures in scoring while the other method has senior standout Jadia Vasquez go wild offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That second option was what the Blue Devils went with on Thursday, March 4 against CCC Region B leader Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Vasquez had an amazing performance, dropping in a career-high tying 30 points, as Plainville turned away the Lancers by a 44-39 final from the Ivan Wood Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But despite the scoring exploits by Vasquez, it was just a one possession game with less than 10 seconds to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late turnover ended any possibility of an Eastern comeback as the Blue Devils held on for a huge victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a chance to win the game in the end,” said acting Eastern coach Mark Camden. “Plainville played well. They played to win the game. They worked hard out there. It’s a well coached team. They do a good job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only four Plainville players scored points that night but that was all the offense the home team needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kori Jones scored five of her seven points over the final 2:59 of the game - hitting three clutch free throws down the stretch - while teammate Lilly Wazorko added five points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win avenged a huge loss by Plainville at Eastern back on Wednesday, February 17 when the Blue Devils fell to the Lancers by forty-four points (77-33). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve been telling these guys all week, it’s going to be a different game when we go to Plainville to play,” said Camden. “It always is every time. We can win a game by 30 or 40 points [and] it doesn’t mean anything when you come here. It’s a different gym. I don’t know if [our players] took me too lightly or what.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ciara Collins led the Lancers with 19 points - on credible 7-of-15 shooting from the field - to go along with seven rebounds, two assists, two blocked shots and four steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sage Scarritt returned to the Eastern line-up, providing six points, eight rebounds, and three assists while Janessa Gonzalez came off the pine for five points and four rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also coming off the bench, freshman Emma Stavens showed glimpses of what she will doing for the Eastern program for years to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She collected four points, six rebounds, and a team-high four assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow freshman Audrey Tice contributed two rebounds, as did Taigan Parent, while Alyssa Kehler added three points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ultimate statistical metrics were in Eastern’s favor as Plainville shot just 32-percent from the field (16-of-50), missed 17 of 21 three-pointers, only managed a handful of assists while committing 16 turnovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern made just 6-of-24 first half field goals, turned the ball over 11 times, and saw a slim second period lead erased when Vasquez scored nine points in a matter of 3:39 to end the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our play in the first half was kind of lackadaisical,” said Camden. “We had a lot of turnovers. We had a lot of open shots but we missed them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers started the showdown on a 7-4 run, capped by a 3 from Collins, while the junior followed up with a quick steal and lay-up as the visitors held a three-point edge 5:25 into things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never scored again in the first frame while Vasquez canned a three-pointer and Jones put back a miss as Plainville snared a 9-7 lead through eight minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens fueled a 6-2 run to open the second period with back-to-back hoops and when Scarritt dropped in two charity tosses with 5:27 before the half, Eastern’s edge was 13-11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cali Doyon (two points, two steals) flipped in a hoop with 3:52 before the half but from there, Vasquez scored all of her team’s points in a 9-2 jaunt that gave Plainville a 24-17 push at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never led in the second half but made things interesting none-the-less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vasquez and Wazorko combined to score nine points over a stretch of 5:23 that gave the Blue Devils a 33-25 cushion with 1:22 left in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Collins found Gonzalez for a hoop and then Eastern’s leading scorer dropped in two points via a slick spin move in the lane to end the third as the Lancers trailed just 33-29 with one quarter to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A steal and lay-up by Vasquez gave Plainville a six-point lead before a hoop and two free throws from Collins, plus a foul shot by Kehler, got Eastern within one at 35-34 with 3:35 left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the second half, we played a little bit better,” said Camden. “We got ourselves into the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squads then exchanged three-point plays as a 3 from Collins kept it a one point contest at 38-37 at the 2:45 mark of the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville slowed things down and attacked, as another spin move from the slick Vasquez found pay dirt but Stavens made a neat pass to Scarritt for a foul line jumper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was still a one point deficit, this time at 40-39, with ninety-seconds showing on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still 40-39 with 25.1 seconds remaining before Jones was fouled - going to the foul line for a one-and-one shooting opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jones calmly sank both free throws but at 42-39 with 22.8 seconds left, Eastern had a shot to tie things up and force overtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the seconds ticking off the clock, the ball never found Collins for that three-point attempt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, the Lancers turned the ball over and Vasquez hit two free throws that made it academic as Plainville scooped up a huge 44-39 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It went down to the wire,” said Camden. “Plainville made the shots in the end and we didn’t.”</p>
