<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re continuing our scholastic football talk in TBE today as the opening contests for both Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern are on the horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have a chance this season to rack up its 300<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;program victory while the Lancers are in the hunt for win No. 250.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol public high school football have combined for 543 victories and will look to add to those totals in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here’s a unique question for today’s conversation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between the two public schools, which program has the most ties?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a close call but Eastern boasts more stalemates than Central, 18-15.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in the day, some conferences did not sanction overtime periods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, some conferences around the state did not have the mechanism, or the means in place, to break ties after four completed periods.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This fall, the squad that the Lancers have tied most in program history is back on the schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of those 18 ties, Eastern and Plainville have drawn five stalemates but don’t expect the same outcome on October 1 from Tinty’s Track and Field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a while since the Lancers defeated the Blue Devils but the schools weren’t regular opponents over the past twenty years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last victory for Eastern over Plainville came back on September 14, 2001, as the Lancers snuck out a 16-14 non-conference win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, with Eastern going 5-5 overall, the Lancers started the campaign at 5-1 - pulling off the opening season victory at Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first win for Eastern head coach Jack Krampitz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored all of its points over the first half while the Eastern defense shutout the Blue Devils over the final 24 minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Al ‘Bubba’ Blumenthal stood out defensively while Eastern quarterback Dave Michaud sealed the deal with a 73 yard TD pass to Alfred Martinez in the second quarter - the ultimate difference maker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along the lines of Eastern’s all-time records, who is the squad the Lancers have beaten the most over the years?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s actually a three-way tie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has defeated Maloney, Platt, and Bristol Central 23 times apiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those victories have come over CCIL, Colonial Conference, and CCC South wars and the squads have all been regular opponents of each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course in 2021, Bristol won’t see the programs from Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Eastern gets to challenge Plainville to open October, Central will take its shot at the Blue Devils on November 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 16 games against Plainville, Central is 10-5-1 all-time against its neighbor (on the CIAC website, it states the game between the Rams and Blue Devils will be played on the Varsity Softball Turf at Plainville high school…).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Central, the Rams carry an all-time record of just over .500 (296-289-15) with the program having big success against those Meriden programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you had to guess, does Central have more victories against Maloney or Platt?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s another close one but the Rams have three more wins against Platt (29) than Maloney (26).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in terms of all-time victories, Central has defeated Eastern more than any other opponent – carrying an all-time ledger of 36-23-2 against its crosstown rival.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those Battle for the Bell showdowns started in 1959 and the Rams have led the series from the onset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What does a typical Central/Eastern Thanksgiving Day game look like from the Rams’ point of view?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s look at the showdown from 2001&nbsp;as Central - and head coach Dennis Perrone - battled Krampitz (boy, that guy gets around) and the Lancers on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had Timmy Washington, the state’s top player, and he rushed for 276 yards on 22 carries against the Lancers as the Rams rang up a 36-12 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington tallied four touchdowns that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Brian Walker rushed for 105 yards on 15 carries and two touchdowns as the Lancers trailed just 15-12 at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a 21-0 run by Central over third period play essentially ended the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams ended the year at 9-1 but just missed out on the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in 2001, only the four top teams in each class advanced to the playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the way, Washington ended his playing days with 9,021 all-purpose yards - an amazing tally.</p>
