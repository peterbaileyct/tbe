<p>From time to time, we’re going to explore the local side of sports in a not so serious way in the pages of TBE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>COVID and this ridiculous pandemic has attempted to put a damper on every day life but we’re going to do our best to take you away from all this tomfoolery with a little scholastic insight and humor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have four items this week:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Item One: </strong>Noted Celtics fan, Bristol Central head coach Tim Barrette, is having conversations with former New York Knicks’ superstar Patrick Ewing…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The real truth: </strong>Thanks to just about every Division I college wanting a certain 7-foot-1 center from Central (that’s Mr. Donovan Clingan to you), Barrette is talking to a lot of coaches - including the head coach from Georgetown, Patrick Ewing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But why is it okay for Barrette to chat it up with Ewing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the 1992 Summer Olympics, the United States sent its ‘Dream Team’ to Barcelona, Spain - as professional players from the NBA made up the men’s basketball team for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ewing and Boston Celtics’ legend Larry Bird were both on the team and quickly became friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why its okay for Barrette and Ewing to have conversations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, if Barrette and Iona coach Rick Pitino were talking, I’d immediately hang up the phone (and change my number).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Item Two: </strong>In a weird scheduling quirk late last week, the CIAC website had the Bristol Eastern boys basketball team on the road to square off against a non-conference opponent in a ‘far away land’…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The real truth: </strong>The Lancers are listed to play Southington on Friday, February 19 and then - on the Eastern varsity boys page - it had Eastern traveling to Staples the following day for a 5 p.m. game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering the pandemic and the fact that Eastern wasn’t going anywhere further than Avon this year, it was a weird quirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was eventually fixed but when checking out Staples schedule before the change was made, the match-up between the schools was never posted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering that the same website had the Bristol boys swimming team’s home meets scheduled on Eastern’s front field, it made you pause for a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That little stream in front of the school couldn’t hold more than one lane, could it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Item Three: </strong>Speaking of Eastern’s front field, what’s the deal with that <em>ridiculous </em>hat girls soccer coach Scott Redman wears during practices?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The real truth: </strong>With that hat, Redman looks likes he should be living in a Florida retirement community, driving around in a golf cart - trying to remember where he put his teeth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all seriousness, Redman has been involved in scholastic sports even before he officially attended high school at Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember Redman was probably in seventh grade, doing the JV scorebook for the boys basketball team at BE, just having a ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s in the blood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman is high-character coach, big on positivity (unless he’s mad and yelling) and loves to teach his kids the games of soccer and softball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that hat!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can see him wearing it from the other side of King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next time you see Redman out on the softball field and you’re driving by in your car, honk your horn at him (several times).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Item Four: </strong>Are we going to see any of our familiar friends at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern at the boys and girls basketball games this year?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The real truth: </strong>I sure hope that we see Jason ‘Coachie’ DeCarolis at the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium (Central) and Jim Tetro from the Thomas M. Monahan Gym (Eastern).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of ‘Coachie’ and what he does at Central, he’s simply tremendous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I need to hear him scream ‘first horn’ and then, while counting down the seconds, call out ‘second horn’ because no one does it better than him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when it comes to Tetro, he’s one of the unsung heroes at Eastern in terms of scholastic sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What he does behind the scenes, whether it’s keeping baseball stats, helping officials, running the scoreboard, and everything else in-between, Eastern is extremely lucky to have him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopefully, those two will make at least a couple of appearances during the winter sports campaign.</p>
