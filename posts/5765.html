<p>WOODSTOCK – The Bristol Eastern baseball team, thanks in part to its hot regular season finish, was able to avoid all the heavy hitters in the CIAC Class L tournament – drawing No. 4 Woodstock Academy for a first-round showdown on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the 29<sup>th</sup> ranked Lancers put a real scare into the Centaurs – allowing the program just two hits as Eastern ace Andrew Lozier gave another outstanding effort to end his senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Woodstock notched three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning as the Lancers fell by a 3-1 decision from the Charles Bentley Athletic Complex in Woodstock – ending its season at 7-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodstock improved to 17-5 and earned a shot at No. 20 Wilton, a 6-5 upset victor over No. 13 Torrington yesterday, in second round action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier was sensational in defeat as he threw a complete game jewel, walking just one and striking out four while allowing just one earned run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He gave up a single to Hamilton Barnes leading off the bottom of the first and a base hit to Zach Roethlien in the three-run fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that was all the offense the Centaurs could muster against the crafty Lozier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had several baserunners erased during game play, having two picked off first base and another caught attempting to steal during the second, third, and fifth innings.<br>Each putout turned into rally killers as Eastern’s early 1-0 push did not hold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers outhit Woodstock, 8-2, had runners on base in six out of the seven innings, but failed to produce any additional runs in support of their pitcher.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill tallied three singles and Lozier had a base hit and a triple to lead the offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that first frame, Churchill led off with a base hit, a soft liner to right field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill later stole second, and then with two outs, he scored on a Ryan Fradette double to right-center, making it a 1-0 game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodstock failed to score over the first three innings of play before the fateful bottom of the fourth came to pass.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the score still 1-0 in the fourth, Lozier hit the first batter of the inning, opposing pitcher Jonathan Smith.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith was then sacrificed to second as the tying runner was in scoring position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zach Roethlein later singled to center, putting runners on second and third with one out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A groundout scored Smith as the game was all tied up at 1-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a base-on-balls to the ensuing batter Trey Ayotte, Roethlein stole third and tagged the dish when the throw went wild – propelling Woodstock to a 2-1 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayotte then stole second and third, later scoring on an infield error for the third run of the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, the 3-1 edge held as Eastern’s season was concluded off a very good showing in state tournament play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss marked the final games for Eastern seniors Trevor Nohilly, Fradette, Gabe Bartolome, Tyler Stickels, Brayden Moore, Logan Schenck, Nate Ouellette, Alex Canzellarini, Tyler Martin, Dylan Woodsome, and Lozier.</p>
