<p>BRISTOL – The history between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern volleyball teams started in 1974 – the first year the squads met.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that early city series encounter, from Bristol Central high school, the Rams defeated the Lancers two games to one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 18-17, 13-15, and 15-10.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was a year ahead of Eastern as a program but once the squads began to grow its rivalry, a pattern quickly emerged.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And since 1977, the Lancers always got to the pay window as Eastern put together a massive winning streak.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coaching some of those teams for Eastern was Ruth Hewston while Central’s Ruthann ‘Foo’ Field (who also coached basketball, tennis, and softball) directed the charge for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern swept the matches in 1977 as 3-0 triumphs were the norm for the Lancers in several bouts against Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first match saw the Lancers defeat the Rams by scores of 15-3, 15-4, and 15-9. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as a historical reminder, all matches were contested to 15 points in scholastic volleyball for the entire 20th century and didn’t change until 2003 when set scores went up to 25 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That first win for Eastern in 1977 saw Karen O’Keefe and Lori Neddermann – two eventual Colonial Conference All-Conference picks – play extremely well while Cindy O’Keefe and Rita Chasse led the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the rematch, tournament qualification was at stake for the Lancers and the Kingstreeters came away with a 15-7, 15-12, and 15-7 victory in a match that was much closer than the first.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 9-6 on the campaign while Central fell to 5-9.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beth Farrar led the charge with 13 points while Karen Carlson, Maurine Achille, O’Keefe and Neddermann played well for the Lancers over the shutout effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chasse led the Rams with nine service points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1978 and 1979, the matches were much more competitive but the end results were the same.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams lost the first match between the schools in 1978 by a three-games-to-one score as Central took the first set but fell in the end (16-18, 15-11, 15-4, and 15-7).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Terry Wolf, Carol O’Regan and Carlson led the charge for Eastern while Greta Lorenson posted 18 service points over the Lancers’ win. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central pushed Eastern to a five-set challenge in the rematch, winning the first two sets (13-15 and 6-15) before dropping the last three games (15-6, 15-3, and 15-10) in a closely contested bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>O’Regan added 17 service points for the victors while Central’s Kim Pavelec led all players with 21 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 6-11 overall while Central fell to 4-11.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both games in 1979 went 3-1 as the Lancers continued to build their winning streak against the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores in Eastern’s first victory against Central were 15-8, 12-15, 15-8, and 15-8 over another highly competitive affair.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Whiteman and Neddermann generated several kills for the Lancers while Terri Castonguay and Pavelec led the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final BC/BE tilt of the 1970s saw Eastern spin Central by scores of 15-10, 15-6, 11-15, and 15-9 in a 3-1 loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win improved Eastern to 8-7 overall while Central ended its season at 4-10.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary Adams and Kathy Huston led the charge offensively for the Lancers while Central’s Carleen Bernosky and Castonguay played well in defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The decade of the 1980s saw Eastern nab early 3-0 sweeps against Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 1980 bouts were quickly taken by the Lancers as Eastern won the first match of the year via scores of 15-0, 15-1, and 15-6 over a romp.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kathy Klett tallied 15 service points in just the first set alone for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the teams took the court again in the rematch, Eastern was victorious again (15-3, 15-6, and 15-3) to move to 12-5 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams fell to 1-15.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was swept in its first Eastern encounter in 1981 by scores of 15-3, 15-10, and 15-11 behind the offense of Beth Kauke and Mary Adams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the rematch saw the Rams push the Lancers to four games before falling 15-11, 12-15, 15-4, and 15-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern struggled overall in 1981 and by the following season, a new coach hit the floor at Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her name was Gail Borkowski (Ericson) and 23 years later, she left an amazing legacy at the school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She posted a 332-139 overall record, won five league titles, made 21 playoff appearances out of 23 seasons, and led the program to three state titles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Borkowski’s effort, energy, and overall knowledge of the sport of volleyball, the Kingstreeters were going to be an vastly improved bunch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the sweeps over the Rams continued into 1982-83 when the Lancers became a state contender in both volleyball in the fall and girls basketball over the winter seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match one in 1982 against Central saw Maureen O’Keefe, Becky Jackson, Marie Forman, and Chryss Watts dominate the Rams over a 15-2, 16-14, and 15-1 victory while the rematch saw the Eastern roll in consecutive sets (15-9, 15-5, and 15-12).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers ended the season at 11-7 and were Class A tournament bound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central continued its winless streak against Eastern in 1983 when the Rams managed just 33 total points over six sets against the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match one saw Eastern rumble up scores of 15-4, 15-4, and 15-7 with Sheila Reidy, Christine Borkowski, O’Keefe, Watts, and Kauke making all the big plays for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern also won the second showdown by scores of 15-1, 15-7, and 15-10 with Christine Borkowski collecting 15 service points to lead the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern went 13-5 in regular season play, was ranked fifth in the Class M fray, and made it all the way to the finals before falling to No. 2 Branford by a 3-0 push (15-4, 15-10, and 15-9) in the Class B title game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, the Lancers finished play at 16-6 and became the first squad in the Mum City to make an appearance in the volleyball championship round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From 1977 to 1983, Eastern generated 14 straight victories over Central before the Lancers’ championship clash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But from there, the Rams had its best stretch of success against the Lancers over seven matches in the mid-1980s.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The volleyball adventures between Central and Eastern will continue in The Bristol Edition in our next installment.</p>
