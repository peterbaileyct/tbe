<p>August 12, 2009 went down in Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League postseason history, as the Bristol Merchants and People’s Bank waged a 19-inning extravaganza that took place from McKenna Field in East Hartford.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A win by the Merchants would have delivered the Bristol franchise another GHTBL postseason championship while a loss meant one more showdown between the teams in a winner-take-all challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what happened that evening?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That game started on August 12 and finished on August 13 in what turned into an insane, unreal game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was simply incredible from start to finish as People’s defeated Bristol by a 3-2 final to stave off elimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It hasn’t even set in yet, to tell you the truth,” said exhausted Bristol coach Bunty Ray after the game.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the longest game (five hours, 11 minutes) in league history according to the Hartford Courant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the contest had a little of everything with players striking out three or four times and a couple critical outs were made at the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had opportunities,” said Ray. “We just didn’t capitalize. At the same time, I thought we were outstanding too.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was People’s third win – out of four tries – against the Merchants that season but it was certainly the most entertaining.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pitching was off-the-charts as 44 strikeouts were posted between some serious heavyweights on the hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Kevin Rival came out of the bullpen to post 22 strikeouts in 13.1 innings of work. It was simply an incredible performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eric Butkiewicz drew the loss for Bristol as baserunners mounted for People’s in the 19th inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone and two on in the 19th, People’s Matt Riemer notched a single against a drawn-in infield as Sam McDonough scored for the final 3-2 score.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was the in-game heroics that fueled an incredible effort by both programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rival came in to pitch during the fourth frame, reliving starter Jarrett Stawarz, and kept it all tied up deep into the marathon game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over Rival’s first 20 batters, 19 were retired – 13 via K – as the game crept into the 12th&nbsp;inning, with seven more stanzas to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next four innings, Rival added five more strikeouts, then two K’s each over the 16th&nbsp;and 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;frames, before eventually being lifted for Butkiewicz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rival’s night saw him allow just three hits, walking just one over 13-plus innings of grueling work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, Rival retired an amazing 28-of-30 batters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kevin, I don’t think in the history of the league has there ever been a performance like that,” marveled Ray. “That’s why you really don’t want to lose a game like this…you don’t want to waste an effort like that.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People’s reliever, John Skinner, was just as sharp over 11.1 innings of work - also out of the bullpen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed only two hits, posted 14 strikeouts, and gave up three walks to earn the win (he might have thrown 180 pitches).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two Bristol runners were caught at home plate with Rick Barrett coming up short, in one attempt, by a country mile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrett tried to score in the 13th&nbsp;and in the 18<sup>th</sup>, a single nearly saw Joe Parlante cross the plate but was called out over a controversial call.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off that play, it appeared Jay Maule had an infield single in hand but the speedster was called out over a bang-bang finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had some opportunities but we weren’t able to capitalize on them,” said Ray. “You have to tip your cap to [People’s]. They came up with the big hit when they had the chance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have to find a way to bounce back.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Merchants scored first in the game off an unearned run while People’s scored two runs in the fourth to secure a 2-1 edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the fifth, three straight two-out singles – the final netting Adam Peters an RBI – made it a 2-2 game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was over two-hours of play without the benefit of a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 13 innings later, People’s finally scored the go-ahead run to secure a 3-2 win, forcing a winner-take-all final showdown the net day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No one is going to forget this one,” said Ray. “I just wish we could have won it.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>People’s pitching gave the Merchants plenty of heartburn&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bankers fanned 19 batters, using three pitchers on the evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eric Fritz and Skinner allowed a combined one earned run in 16 innings of work, walking just four over the grueling event.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I knew coming in that Fritz and Skinner were going to give us fits,” said Ray. “Hats off to them. We just have to come back and win [the final game]. That’s a tall order.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Want more from the 19-inning war?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a list of all the tomfoolery from that fateful People’s/Merchants’ playoff game on August 12:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Joe Parlante was 4-for-9 – accounting for a good chuck of Bristol’s 12 total hits. He scored a run and had a double to lead the offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Ray (2-for-8) and Nick Macellaro (2-for-6, three walks) were the only other Bristol batters with multiple hit games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Chris Klepps, Rival, and Matt Hackney – all excellent hitters – were a combined 0-for-21 that night. Klepps was HBP (twice by Skinner), and Hackney was intentionally walked and reached base twice via errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol left 19 men on base and batted .171 for the game over 70 at-bats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The Merchants stole six bases with Maule (two) leading the charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*People’s committed six errors in the game, the first allowing Parlante to net Bristol’s initial run of the contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*To end the game, Bristol went scoreless over its final 14-plus innings at the plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*People’s Wes Ulbrich, for instance, went 1-for-8 and had a single in his last at-bat. In his seven previous trips to plate, he hit into a fielder’s choice and struck out a game high SIX times. He looked at strike three an amazing <em>three</em> times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*People’s leadoff batters, Matt Riemer and Bassani, went a combined 5-for-16 – all singles. But Riemer had the game-winning hit to clinch the event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bunty’s final word on the game&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s not a typical game obviously,” said Ray. “Somebody has to win and somebody has to lose. We have to find a way to bounce back and it’s tough. All the momentum you had in the tournament [is gone] and now you have a winner-take-all [scenario]. You have to find a way to come back and put this one behind us.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The end results&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, August 14, Bristol won in the rematch – seizing the GHTBL postseason title by an 8-4 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Pacyna came out of the bullpen to earn the win, allowing just six hits over 4.2 innings pitched.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the final postseason title for the Merchants as the squad disbanded after the 2011 campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Next week in TBE Sports Sunday…&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When TBE Sunday rolls around next week, we’ll look at the 2010 season for the Bristol Merchants as the squad had another terrific season in the GHTBL play.&nbsp;</p>
