<p>With a light mist falling over Bristol only hours before Tropical Storm Henri makes landfall and introduces itself to Bristol, some businesses are still open. At the same time, residents continued to busy themselves in the early morning hours.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Dunkin Donuts on Farmington Ave., near CVS, is open and, according to employees, will remain open until they lose power. As the hour approached 8 a.m., the drive thru line extended out to Mix St. Its sister store, a mere half-mile away at the corner of King St. and Farmington Ave., saw an uptick in customers as the morning progressed. </p>

<p>Many businesses along Farmington Ave. were open at 7 a.m. including Starbucks, McDonald’s and Stop and Shop. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Gregory Church had a healthy amount of parishioners at that hour attending morning mass. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a spattering of walkers made use of Rockwell Park.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the Boulevard was quiet but for the geese which took up residence in the field. </p>

<p>Forestville saw morning shoppers purchasing last-minute items at Stop &amp; Shop on Pine St. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not to be outdone, Cumbies in the center of Forestville had a steady stream of customers seeking everyday items and gas.&nbsp;</p>
