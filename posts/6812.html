<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol American Legion baseball team’s showdown against West Hartford this past Wednesday was a bit of a state tournament preview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with a 3-1 victory over Post 96, Bristol (16-6 overall, 14-5 Zone 1) earned another signature victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s just a huge game,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “It was a real good team win and put us in a good spot.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The triumph over West Hartford on Wednesday saw a surprise start for Bristol’s Andrew Lozier who was just eligible to throw again after his 104-pitch victory over Naugatuck last Friday (14-7).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roberto Cruz was in line to start against West Hartford but was not available for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was next man up for Bristol and Lozier (7 IP, 6 hits, 10 strikeouts, 103 pitches) was the man of the hour and came through like a champ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I felt really good,” said Lozier of the win. “I actually wasn’t even supposed to pitch today. Roberto was supposed to pitch. He wasn’t feeling well so I was like ‘all right, I guess I’m on the mound.’ I went in and did my thing.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier zipped up his fourth victory over the winning effort and is perfect this season (4-0) with two complete game efforts over 29 innings of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even going the distance against West Hartford, Lozier will be eligible to throw in Bristol’s first state tournament game despite the pitch count rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol is the Zone 1 leader…and looks to finish there</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is ready to seize another Zone 1 title as the regular season comes to a conclusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We pretty much set ourselves up to be first place in the zone and get a great seed” in the Connecticut State American Legion tournament said LaPenta. “We can get home games [in Bristol] for the first two rounds. So today was a huge, huge [win against West Hartford].”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A loss would have positioned Zone 1 with three squads tied with six losses apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Except West Hartford (10-7 entering Saturday) fell to surging Berlin on Friday, dropping a 8-2 decision, as the team squandered a chance at a first place finish in Zone 1 after a fast start to the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A tie of sorts still could be in the cards if someway, somehow, Post 2 loses its game at Simsbury on Sunday (11 a.m. from Memorial Field).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Avon entered Saturday 12-6 in Zone 1 play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Right now, we’re in the lead in losses,” said LaPenta. “We have one more game against Simsbury.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden is 11-5 and it’s yet to be determined if the team will make up any of its remaining Zone 1 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reality is that Bristol will never get its rubber match against Meriden - splitting the season series against the program (1-1).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s probably not going to be made up,” said LaPenta of Meriden. &nbsp;</p>
