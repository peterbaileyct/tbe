<p>The 2020 Little League Softball season officially commenced in Bristol on Monday, with a twin billing from beautiful Peck Park and Rockwell Field.  The major division Rockies and Diamond Girls played to a 14-0 score in 5 innings from Peck Park, with a combined no-hitter from pitchers Hailey Beebe, Haley Powers and Stella Sirianni to give the Diamond Girls the opening day win.  The Rockies only allowed 4 hits themselves, as the  Diamond Girls were able to draw a total of 17 walks.   Haley Powers had 2 hits and a walk for the Diamond Girls.<br>Catcher Angelina Croce reached base safely twice for the Rockies, nearly scoring the team's first run of the season on a play at the plate.<br><br>Two other major division teams played what could be viewed as a rematch of the 2019 City Series Championship, as Panthers hosted the Gators at Rockwell Field.  Leah Webber pitched three solid innings to lead the Gators to a 17-13 win.  Bellah Loveall pitched the fourth inning and Brooklynne Whitlock threw two no-hit innings to seal the Gatorsâ€™s first victory of the season.  Desiree Nickerson reached base safely in all four plate appearances, scoring four runs, with a single and 3 walks for the Panthers.  Bella Arborio pitched four innings for Panthers, reaching base safely in three of her four at bats.
