<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - The Mum City once again has a squad playing in the New England Collegiate Baseball League as the Bristol Blues are one of 14 squads competing in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The season is comprised of 44 games over an eight week stretch and once August rolls around, the playoffs begin. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NECBL is one of the top summer leagues around and since 1993, some of the nation’s top collegiate players compete there.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s been a tough start to the season for the newest NECBL franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Blues reside in last place in the Southern Division at 3-10.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Newport Gulls (7-3) leads the Blues’ division in the South while the Upper Valley Nighthawks and Vermont Mountaineers (7-4) head the pack in the North Division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is 5.5 games behind the Gulls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, there are ten players on this squad who are from Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues are represented by the towns of Waterbury, Rockville, Lakeside, Bethel, Westport, Madison, Bloomfield, Avon, Glastonbury, and Woodbridge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in this league, every New England state has a franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides the Blues, the Mystic Schooners (Groton) and Danbury Westerners all are from Connecticut.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other 11 programs are in Massachusetts (four teams), Vermont (two), New Hampshire (two), Rhode Island (two), and Maine (one).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muzzy Field is the largest venue in the NECBL with a 4,900-seating capacity while the Keene Swamp Rats compete at Alumni Field in New Hampshire (4,800).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally, Bristol had an NECBL franchise in 2010 that lasted one season as the Bristol Collegiate Baseball Club.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That team became the Mystic Schooners, an opponent Bristol has been competing against this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the first Bristol team in the NECBL was the Bristol Nighthawks in the mid-1990s.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Season to Date for the Blues</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dropping its first game, the Blues defeated OceanState by an 8-6 on June 4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scored four runs in both the first and third frames to secure the victory from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mark Faello won the game for the Blues, going five innings, allowing six hits, three earned runs while striking out five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>James Kirkpatrick grabbed the save over a one inning, two strikeout effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues racked up seven hits as Theodore Hague and Tyler Keith had two apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brock Murtha walked three times as the Blues netted 12 total base-on-balls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Bristol dropped nine straight games before ramping up consecutive victories - both from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Friday, the Blues defeated Newport 6-5 and then on Saturday, the Blues were 5-3 winners over Vineyard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Mystics, the home team fell behind by a 5-0 push over the first three innings of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol notched single runs in the fourth and fifth frames to put a dent in the deficit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the locals bombed the Schooners for four runs in the seventh to steal away the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A huge two-run homer by Brennen Dorighi in the seventh stanza helped set the wheels in motion over what turned into an epic comeback by Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christian Fedko and Keith each tallied two hits over the wining effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Justin Humenay won the game for the Blues, pitching a scoreless seventh frame that included a strikeout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then a four run seventh fueled the Blues in the two-run victory over the Sharks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fedko and Murtha each smacked out two hits while Keith added his third double of the season, collecting two RBI in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jacob Moskowitz won the contest in relief, tossing 1.1 innings that included one K.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over its three wins this season, Bristol has beaten those opponents by a total of five runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upcoming Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues battle Valley tonight at 5:05 p.m. from McKenzie Stadium but three of the next four games for the locals will be played in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, the Blues tangles with OceanState (6:30 p.m.) before playing the same squad over a home-and-home challenge on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has Thursday off before battling Mystic on Friday and Danbury on Saturday from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both games commence at 6:30 p.m.</p>
