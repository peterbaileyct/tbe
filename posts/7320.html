<p>The Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League has announced its 2021 All-star roster and alternates and one of the members from the Bristol Greeners made the squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol coach A.J. Lorenzetti will be playing for the All-star team as twenty-seven players from the GHTBL will be representing the league in the exhibition games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti led the Greeners (5-15 overall in 2021) into battle this year and was the team’s most productive hitter in the line-up for the Bristol contingent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The catcher batted a healthy .321 in 53 at-bats while tallying 17 hits overall – including five doubles, two triples and six RBI as Lorenzetti led his team in all those categories.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He walked four times, carried a .390 on-base percentage while slugging the ball at a .491 clip.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti also did a little pitching for Bristol and did not allow a run in three innings of action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He saved one game and fanned two over his stint on the hill for the Greeners.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti will have a chance to play in two All-Star games this weekend before the completion of league play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GHTBL All-Stars will compete against both the Connecticut Twilight League All-Stars this Friday at 7 p.m. from Palmer Field in Middletown and on Sunday versus the George Donnelly Sunset League All-Stars.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final All-Star showcase takes place from Dodd Stadium in Norwich at 4 p.m.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>East Hartford wins the 2021 postseason tournament&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Jets won the GHTBL championship on August 15, posting a 5-2 victory over the Vernon Orioles to claim the title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Hartford went a perfect 4-0 in postseason play, outscoring opponents 22-10 along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the second consecutive year that the Jets won the postseason tournament as the program is one of a long line of back-to-back champions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bristol GHTBL History&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of championships, the Bristol Merchants were both the regular and postseason champs in 2009 while seizing the regular season title in 2010. That was the last time a GHTBL team from Bristol laid claim to those championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>TBE will continue to look at those final Bristol Merchants squads over the next few weeks in Sport’s Sunday.</p>
