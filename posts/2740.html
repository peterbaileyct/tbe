<p>The governor's executive order allowing all absentee ballots that are post marked with today's date and arrive by Thursday is an exercise in caution, showing how the use of mail-in ballots is a work in progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are four sections to the order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first section allows for an absentee ballot to be counted if specific information is included on either the outer or inner envelope, rather than a specific envelope. The implication here might be that people may neglect to complete the information on both. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That information would be "the elector’s name, an address, voting district, the date of the primary at which the ballot is to be cast, the name of the party holding the primary, and the serial number associated with the elector’s absentee ballot application."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second section exonerates a voter who completes the absentee ballot using COVID-19 as a reason. The document reads: "An elector shall not be deemed to have made a false statement regarding his or her eligibility to vote by absentee ballot in the August 11, 2020 primary if the elector votes by absentee ballot because of the sickness of COVID-19 and signs an attestation on the inner envelope that does not reference COVID-19.</p>
