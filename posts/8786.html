<p>BC came out of the gate and kept the ball in the opposing side of the field for much of the first half but could not find the back of the net. </p>

<p>Although Central was around the E.O. Smith goal most of the half, the home team had the best chance in the first 40 minutes. A perfectly timed run put the ball on the foot of the Panthers striker and sent him in one-on-one. But Umar Malick, in net for the injured Harry Ross, made a great save to keep the score tied at 0-0.</p>

<p><br>The Rams did their scoring in the second half and netted 2 goals. The first came off of a free kick which was a result of more pressure from the BC midfielders. A perfectly lofted free kick by Mark Palma found the head of Carson Rivoira who sent it towards goal, where Ethan Crumrine tapped it in for the only goal Central would need.</p>

<p> BC added an insurance goal by Rivoira off of a beautiful through ball from Palma. From there, the Rams were never threatened and they methodically finished out the game. </p>

<p>The Rams are now 10-2-2 on the season.  They face a challenge when they travel to Conard this Friday for a 3:45 contest. The regular season ends with a Monday match vs. Bristol Eastern.</p>
