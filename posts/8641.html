<p>Come Sunday morning, I will have been discharged from physical therapy for my knee replacement. It’s kind of good, but the work has only&nbsp;begun:&nbsp;continue my exercises two to three times a day for at least six months and then three times a week forever, which I am totally okay with. I am used to a regular exercise routine and so it’s just more of the same. It’s all good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That was Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backing up to last Sunday, I made several trips to Bakery on Maple (and earlier in the week to Harvest for their raspberry cheese coffee cake and a dozen donuts to bring to work). On the way home from Bakery on Maple, someone called my name, and a turned to see my brother pulling to the curb on the opposite side of Maple. We chatted for a few minutes, catching up, as traffic passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then I was on my way home. And it was only Sunday, and Monday was a holiday. That is always something to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This holiday ended with the NAACP candidate forum at United Prospect Methodist Church. It’s a beautiful venue, and the turnout was&nbsp;pretty solid. I took some notes, audio-taped the event, and have been thinking about how to write it up. I am still working that out. If anything, it will be a slow news report, and not at all simply a blow-by-blow account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thursday&nbsp;I arrived late to the naming of the cross-country course at Page Park for the late Johnie Floyd, the first Black teacher in the Bristol school system and a cross-country coach, who eventually made his way to Central Connecticut State University as the admissions director. Johnie Floyd was always, and is always, Mr. Floyd to me. He was the father of a close friend, Daryl, and through that relationship I benefitted from his wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Floyd’s niece, Charise, was still at Page Park Pavilion where the dedication ceremony took place. She was chatting with her close friend and BCHS cross-country coach, Tamara Stafford-Kirk, so we got to talking and before long Charise shared some photos and videos of the event. It’s not like being there, but it was pretty close. A family photo and video are included with Mike Letendre’s article. </p>

<p>After the Floyd event, I skipped over to a Bristol Arts and Culture Fund open house off East Rd. It was just a quick stop to see what was up, and there was plenty going on, from the graffiti artist outside to the arts &amp; craft station and live music inside. More on this concern in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And Friday was Mary and I’s first night out, a quick dinner and afterwards Hartford Stage for “Ah, Wilderness,” Eugene O’Neill’s sole comedy, a sweet coming of age story. As always it was a typical Hartford Stage production with a spectacular stage setting and wonderful casting. For me, the audience was smaller than usual, which was fine for the time being.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, Saturday brought the 100th anniversary celebration of Memorial Boulevard, an all-day affair with a bunch of presentations by Bristol’s historical experts peopling stations at the various monuments, live music, food truck, and speeches. I limped around for over an hour, chatting and taking some photos. And then it was time to head home.&nbsp;</p>
