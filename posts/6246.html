<p>Come Sunday morning, summertime will have become official with the end of the school year, the first music concert at the Rockwell Park amphitheater, a family birthday party and more time with grandkids. And, of course, there was a Blues game in there somewhere. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, summer will have come regardless of high school graduation—there is nothing to stop the summer solstice—at least not yet. But graduation as ceremony and ritual&nbsp;definitely helps, especially in a year such as&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;just had.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took until Saturday to feel comfortable walking into a store without a mask, and even then, most times, I still carry one with me, and oftentimes, I still wear one if the workers are masked.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first of the free summer concert series at the Rockwell Park amphitheater was postponed on Tuesday, to Wednesday. As Mary and I drove through the parking lot, which was packed, we thought that&nbsp;perhaps there&nbsp;might have been a Blues game going on at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hundreds of people showed up with their blankets and folding chairs for a great show by Darik and the Fun Bags, a cover band, that really knows how it get things going. It was a beautiful evening at a beautiful spot and, what’s best, it’s right here and available to everyone. </p>

<p>Saturday was a busy day with a trip to see girl baby grandchild, our nephew’s 40th surprise birthday party and, wait, fireworks on Cedar Lake. A busy day with over 125 miles added to the mileage on my car. Baby&nbsp;grand girl, who, at&nbsp;18 months&nbsp;is babbling and bopping around, and even doing some gardening. She has her own tools and is fond of watering her marigolds and lettuce.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The birthday party brought together my nephews neighbors and family at his home for one of the first celebrations of marking the near-to-end of the coronavirus pandemic here in the state and Bristol. He and his spouse, and first son, welcomed baby boy No. 2 during the pandemic, so it was fun finally to get together. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you are wondering, the 40-year-old says he was not at all surprised.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I was surprised by an old classmate from BCHS, whose name I could not recall—yes, I am embarrassed—but whose face, even after all these years, was&nbsp;totally familiar. Sorry, Roger. Who could ever forget that head of hair!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And fireworks on Cedar Lake. The association members kick in the bucks and the fireworks fly. This show was a good if not better than the fireworks at Lake Compounce, which are always a favorite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, I had not been on Cedar Lake, since Kory Lane was a beach, where my family spent plenty of time every summer.&nbsp;Needless to say, things&nbsp;have changed, and the beach is now a series of backyards for some&nbsp;pretty impressive&nbsp;homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s&nbsp;more impressive is the lake, with the wind thumping across its surface, the steady whoosh and lapping of the lake waters against the shore. Various boats&nbsp;skim&nbsp;the surface, and at least one, pulled water skiers.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;hard to think of it as being just up the hill. But better here than not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the city front, the Governor’s office announced a great big grant to help with the cleanup of the Sessions Building on Riverside Ave., clearing the way for the building’s redevelopment into apartments. Other than that, the Charter Revision Committee met again to discuss a four-year term for the mayor’s office, which got shot down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Look for more activities on our weekly calendar, and send along items for Neighborhood Notes. We posted a short story about a bear sighting along the Bristol/Plainville border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is wildlife everywhere. On one of my daily walks, when I reached the corner of Woodland and Oakland, I did a double take when I saw a rabbit bounding across a lawn. A second later, a second rabbit joined the first, before darting away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some reading. This article from The New York Times is instructive for how it connects the dots.
