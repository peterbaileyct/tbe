<p>EAST HARTFORD - The Bristol Greeners just completed its third year of baseball in as many leagues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that wasn’t such a bad thing for the Bristol contingent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a three-win campaign in 2019, the pandemic saw the Connecticut Tri-State Baseball League cancel its campaign in 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That cancellation actually spelled the end of the Bristol Greeners 11-year run in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners moved on to the Nutmeg State Baseball League - an entry that only played on Sundays - over 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals were extremely successful in the league, winning over a dozen games, and was more than competitive in Nutmeg State play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That win total was the most the Bristol contingent compiled since posting 19 victories in Tri-State action during the summer of 2013.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for the 2021 summer season, Greeners’ head coach A.J. Lorenzetti and crew joined up with the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol went 5-15 overall in its first year of action and wasn’t that far off from the Bristol Merchants (2001-2011) initial win total (7-21).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve definitely seen [positive] gains in some places,” said Lorenzetti of playing in the GHTBL. “It’s always tough when you have a young team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, when wins were a little easier to come by in Tri-State play, the Greeners saw success with players like Tyler Bush, T.J. Wyrebek, Reid Roberge, and Tyler Cyr.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With those veterans moving on, the locals have gotten a bit more youthful in terms of talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2016 unit won eight games and in 2018, the Greeners snared 11 victories and played in the Tri-State Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this season, Lorenzetti and Jerry LaPenta led a squad with the likes of Zach Marquis, Ben Mazzone, Kenny Knox, Trevor Mays, Noah Fradette, and Stephen Warkoski.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those guys have a history playing ball in Bristol but that group was a bit on the youthful side overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had an older core that kind of filtered out a couple years ago,” said Lorenzetti. “It’s a new core with some of the guys my age starting to filter out a little bit too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The 2021 Team</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off that 5-15 ledger, the Greeners lost six games by three runs or less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Bristol went 2-4 over its six games and all four of those losses were within three runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a frustrating six-game losing streak after that second win but the Greeners went 3-4 to end the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was 5-13 in regular season action and went 0-2 in the GHTBL postseason tournament, dropping its final game of the year to the Hartford Colts by a 6-5 decision in nine innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Stats</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t all doom and gloom as Lorenzetti was named a GHTBL All-Star with an average of .321 to pace the squad during the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan Bartis hit .250 for the year while Mazzone hung in with a .242 average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jon Pierce was second on the squad in hits (12) while Jonah Giblin was tied with Mazzone for this place (eight).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayes (27 Ks) started six games on the mound for the Greeners this year, Knox (2-2) was one of the league leaders in ERA at 2.10 as was LaPenta (1.46 ERA in 19.2 IP) when he was healthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Casey Horjus was 2-2 with two saves and a team-leading 28 strikeouts while Warkoski carried a 2.06 ERA in 17 innings pitched.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the program can do is improve for 2022 campaign and with a player or two from Bristol American Legion’s baseball team (19-7 in 2021), the Greeners expect to be much better next summer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Next year, we’ll hopefully be able to reload with a few guys off the [Bristol American] Legion team. I know the Legion team won the zone this year so I know there’s a lot of talent there and hopefully, we can just pick up a few more pieces.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are definitely not too far away.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The coach</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti has done a solid job leading the Greeners over the past five years or so as the program’s coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s put together a very competitive Bristol outfit and the life-long catcher gets to do a little more coaching on the field and not just from the dugout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The catcher is always kind of he captain of the field,” said Lorenzetti. “So it’s a bit second nature. It’s nice that I can tell what the pitchers are doing. As for the offensive standpoint, a lot of the guys have good at-bats. Certain guys know when to run, guys know when to lay down a bunt so there’s definitely at lot of mature players that makes it easier.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was certainly a little bit more challenging this year with [my school stuff] but it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed coming to play every night.”</p>
