<p>On Wednesday, the 2020 Under Armour All-American Volleyball Awards will be handed out and three players from the undefeated program at Bristol Eastern are in the mix to receive those honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryley Plourde, Zoe Lowe, and Leah Chipman were all nominated for the award and any of the trio would make worthy picks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are 11-0 overall this season with one home match left to go in the 2020 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plourde has been a steady performer over the years for the Eastern program and this season, the senior dropped down 96 kills, served 10 aces, blocked nine shots, and bumped up 16 digs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plourde has turned up the intensity as of late, posting 38 kills over her last three matches - including 18 in the five-match war against Bristol Central last week. She’s had 10-plus kills in six matches while blocking three shots over three different games.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Zoe Lowe has been sensational over her four-year varsity career at Eastern and is a state leader in multiple statistical categories. Lowe smashed down a team-leading total of 130 kills, 39 alone over two matches against Central, along with 48 aces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her kill total is the fourth highest in the state while her ace count sees Lowe check in at No. 5 in Connecticut. She has also added 104 digs and 164 serve receives to her impressive numbers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Chipman is tops in assists - collecting 318 to lead the Nutmeg State with Central’s Gwen Torreso following in second place at 297.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has 21 aces, a serving percentage over 90-percent, and has bumped up 64 digs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman even has 10 kills to her name, slipping down a couple balls that have turned the tide of more than a couple of sets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the AVCA high school All-Region Teams will be announced on Wednesday, the Under Armor All-American selections will be announced on November 11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The AVCA received a record number of nominations for the 2020 Under Armour All-American Awards this year with nearly 975 selections made from the scholastic ranks.&nbsp;</p>
