<p>The undefeated girls basketball squad from Plainville came into the Thomas M . Monahan Gymnasium on the campus of Bristol Eastern on Wednesday with a boatload of momentum after two victories over recent nip-and-tuck battles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after thirty-minutes of warfare against the Lancers, that perfect ledger was no more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern junior Ciara Collins led another huge charge as the locals zipped up a 77-33 thrashing over the Blue Devils.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, still perfect on the campaign (3-0), coasted out to a 20-0 cushion and never looked back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins zapped Plainville for 25 points – including four three-pointers – to go along with eight rebounds, six assists and a couple steals to complete another impressive all-around effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alyssa Kehler added 14 points and five rebounds, Cali Doyon contributed 13 points, three rebounds, six assists and three steals while Taigan Parent cashed in a career-high eight points and snared two rebounds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sage Scarritt (10 points, nine rebounds) was just short of a double-double while Emma Stavens (four points, four assists) and Audrey Tice (five rebounds) had good debut outings for the home team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Piendak (three points) added a little offense for Eastern as well to end the contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jada Vasquez led the Blue Devils with 11 points and hustled over the losing effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville struggled early as Eastern got into its trapping defense and once the squad forced miscues and turnovers, the Lancers were off and running – turning to its transition offense for easy lay-ups and jumpers. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent hit a couple jumpers early in Eastern’s initial scoring surge and when Kehler went for three consecutive hoops, the Lancers constructed a 20-0 edge with 3:27 to play in the first quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville simply never got into the offensive flow and could not give Eastern any kind of offensive challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One last three-point bomb, hit by Collins off a sweet connection from Doyon, ended first quarter play as the Lancers held a 23-6 push through eight minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins truly spaced out the game to open the second tilt as she canned a 3, made a couple charity tosses, dropped in another trifecta and then when the junior flashed in two additional free throws, Eastern’s lead was 33-8 midway through the quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s offense was still sputtering, only mustering a free throw late in the first half, as the Lancers snared a 45-9 lead at intermission.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern continued to turnover Plainville in the third quarter and by the completion of the stanza, the Lancers outscored the visitors 18-13 and trailed 63-22 with one period remaining.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late in the game, Piendak canned her three-point play and Eastern emptied its bench with Vanessa Drury, Sarah Lacouture, Lauren Ayotte, Madison Charette, and Gracie Lamar all seeing action as Eastern romped up a 44-point win to stay perfect on the year.&nbsp;</p>
