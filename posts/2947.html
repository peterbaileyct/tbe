<p>Coach Adrienne Bentley was very pleased with the team's performance, both in and out of the pool.  "We had great swims all around. I was nervous about maintaining social distancing during what has always been a very electric competition, but the Ladies did a fabulous job maintaining social distancing, cheering each other on and handling business in the pool.&nbsp; We had 17 best times and the girls looked fabulous and strong!"</p>
