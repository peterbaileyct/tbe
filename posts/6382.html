<p>The 2021 ShopRite Nutmeg State Games will soon be off and running and this Saturday, three local favorites will be in competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And these three are familiar names when it comes to local figure skating in the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carol, Jenny, and Jilleen Surgue will all hit the ice on Saturday, competing over different events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carol is the veteran of the bunch, competing at the highest level between the siblings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She will be attending the University of Hartford in September.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carol played softball in Bristol over the years with Bristol Girls Little League Softball, as has Jenny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Jenny, she will be competing Saturday at one classification under Carol at the games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jenny's signature skating move is a cantilever, invented by Werner Groebli.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She played golf this past spring for Central and will be entering her junior year this coming fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Jilleen Sugrue will competing in the Ladies Singles Basic 6 class at the games. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The impressive fifth grader from St. Joe’s is also a Little Leaguer in her spare time, playing for the Pink Panthers in the Minors this past season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Figure Skating portion of competition will take place from the Newington Arena at 300 Alumni Road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Placement for the competitors was determined by the 6.0 system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Awards will be presented for first, second, and third place finishers in each group and the 2021 ShopRite Nutmeg State Games Figure Skating Championship is a qualifying competition for the 2022 National State Games of America Championships (SGA).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, all Medal Winners qualify for the 2022 State Games of America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all three of Bristol’s outstanding skaters expect to have a big Saturday in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skating is just one of the many individual sports that will be taking place at the games in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other individual sports include Archery, BMX, Cycling, Fencing, Golf, Gymnastics, Judo, Pickleball, Shooting, Youth Swimming, Track &amp; Field, Wrestling and - of course - Figure Skating.</p>
