<p>Bristol is about to become the hotbed of baseball and softball over the next three weeks or so as Little Leaguers invade the A. Bartlett Giamatti Little League Center on mix street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tournaments are a go in 2021 with several restrictions in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The safety of the athletes, coaches, and families is the primary concern of Little League International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For those teams that get the opportunity of representing their state at a Little League Baseball or Softball Region Tournament, and then potentially advance to our World Series in Greenville, North Carolina, and Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Little League International is committed to organizing these events in as safe and responsible manner as possible, with the physical and emotional well-being of all participants and families paramount,” according to Littleleague.org. “Teams are strongly encouraged to have limited to no interactions with any individual outside of their <strong><em>team pod</em></strong> (players, coaches, and manager), and Little League International staff will make every effort to coordinate each team’s time at all tournament locations to provide coordinated schedules for each team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there are strict guidelines for both Little League Baseball and Softball Tournaments in terms of attendance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seating inside all stadiums will be limited to the “Team Pass” holders of the two teams playing in that game and any other individuals with “Friends and Family” pass issued by Little League International according to a release from Little League.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each team at all tournaments will receive up to 250 team passes to be distributed to their families, friends, and community members.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the stadiums will be cleared at the end of each game to provide the next teams’ pass holders the opportunity to enter the stadiums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of Breen Field admission, it will be limited to the pass holders from the teams playing at the time and the limited “Friends and Family” pass holders.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, social distancing, masks, hand washing and all best practices are encouraged while attending games and events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s also important to follow any rules, signs, and announcements at the Giamatti Center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pairings for the 2021 Little League Baseball are still being played out but the Softball East Regional Tournament, commencing from July 24-29, is set.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the baseball side, the Mid-Atlantic and New England Regionals commence from Breen Field on August 8-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The New England Regional is made up of squads from six states while the Mid-Atlantic tournament will have Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. battling it out.</p>
