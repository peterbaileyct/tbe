<p>I’ve asked this once and now, I’m going to poise this question one more time:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you ready for some football?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think many of our readers have been ready for a little 11-v-11 football since the conclusion of the Battle for the Bell in 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the last time that our local teams took to the gridiron seems like a lifetime ago for most of us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, we’re about ten days away from the start of the 2021 campaign for both the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who truly knows how the seasons will go for each team but the bottom line is Friday Night Lights are returning to the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve peeked at the schedules for both teams over the last couple months and in terms of opponents, it won’t be business as usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The focus today are the new opponents both Central and Eastern will compete against for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s the constant between both Bristol squads in 2021?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There won’t be any Middletown or Windsor teams to tangle with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a big deal because in terms of history, the Rams and Lancers have struggled against both the Blue Dragons and Warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol squads carry a combined eight wins against Middletown and Windsor over its collective history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, the Bristol squads have 37 losses against those powerful foes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has never beaten Middletown (0-9) and last defeated Windsor 30-28 back on October 25, 2014 via a game-winning 25 yard field goal by Jeremy Meccariello.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central beat Windsor by a 34-6 final in October of 2019 but the Rams carry 10 more losses than victories against the Warriors all-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in another weird quirk this year, the Meriden squads (Platt and Maloney) are not on the Bristol slate in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s very rare that Maloney and Platt won’t be playing Bristol as the teams from Meriden are a long time CCC South rival for Central and Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having those opponents off the schedule means new teams and challengers on the horizon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central will battle a squad it has never competed against before while Eastern has two new teams scheduled for this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will square off against Tolland on October 22 and the battle should be a good one for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles were 7-3 in 2019 playing in the CCC, Division III East line-up and will be stepping up a bit in competition against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tolland will certainly have its hands full against future UCONN standout Victor Rosa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Eastern, the locals have non-conference Wilbur Cross to compete against on September 24 while October 8 will see the Lancers battle Capital/Achievement - an opponent of Central over the last few years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the season unfolds for Central and Eastern, TBE will explore each showdown every week as scholastic football returns to the Mum City.</p>
