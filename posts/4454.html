<p>People in town know Dr. Charles “Randy” Robinson as an ophthalmologist, but few people know that in 2020 he became an All-Star baseball player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robinson&nbsp;plays for&nbsp;a&nbsp;local amateur sports team,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/CTMustangs/" target="_blank">Bristol Mustangs</a>, a member of the&nbsp;35+ division of the Connecticut North Men's Baseball League.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I joined&nbsp;the Mustangs in 2017&nbsp;and play either right field or second base,” said Robinson in a phone&nbsp;interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the 2020 season, he was voted an All-Star by his teammates. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Half the team was ineligible,” said Robinson.&nbsp;“I&nbsp;only played in the&nbsp;all-star&nbsp;game,&nbsp;probably based upon my efforts, or my enthusiasm…not based on innate skill.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robinson is&nbsp;the&nbsp;oldest member of the Mustangs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Baltimore, Maryland native, Robinson moved to Bristol with his wife, Ann, in 1989.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started a two-man practice, Bristol Eye Associates, in July&nbsp;of&nbsp;that same year. After 30 years, his partner retired in 2020. In November,&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;joined another practice, Bristol Eye Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robinson&nbsp;received his&nbsp;undergraduate degree,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from Cornell University,&nbsp;and completed&nbsp;medical school&nbsp;at the&nbsp;University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Nov. 22, 1980, he met&nbsp;Ann, who was originally from&nbsp;Philadelphia.&nbsp;She was a nurse at the same hospital when he was at med school at the University of Pennsylvania, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We met at a party at my house,” said Robinson.&nbsp;“But then I didn't meet her again until three months later when I saw her on&nbsp;the&nbsp;hospital floor and then asked her out.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After medical school, Robinson said he went to Boston for a year of internship and South Carolina for two years of public health service.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he then went to Philadelphia for three years of ophthalmology residency and the District of Columbia for a year-long retina fellowship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We moved&nbsp;five&nbsp;times before we got to Connecticut,” said Robinson.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robinson said Ann is currently the head of the cardiopulmonary department at Bristol Hospital. He said they often have the same patients.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Some may be seen in cardio rehab and others in my office,” said Robinson. “We share a lot of them&nbsp;at&nbsp;the same time.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said it's always interesting when a patient might make the connection when they see a picture of Ann on his desk and ask, “That's your wife?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Patients ask me, ‘Are you retiring?’ and I say ‘Yes’ … I just don't know when,” said Robinson. “Probably close to the destination of our eventual grandchildren.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robinson treasures his family and marriage. He and Anne both enjoy ballroom dancing, once a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She is such a wonderful person,” said Robinson. “It’s been an easy marriage.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also said that he treasures the comradery he has with his Mustangs teammates. During his birthday week, there were party celebrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One was with my family--my wife, two kids and daughter's fiancé -- and the other was with my second family -- the Mustangs,” said Robinson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Randy the Elder” was crowned “King” by&nbsp;his Mustangs teammates when they roasted him for his birthday late in December at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fivecornersbistro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Corners</a>,&nbsp;a Bistro &amp; Craft Bar in Farmington.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His teammates paid&nbsp;him&nbsp;homage&nbsp;with&nbsp;the beer,&nbsp;<a href="https://russianriverbrewing.com/pliny-the-elder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pliny The Elder</a>.&nbsp;They&nbsp;customized the label,&nbsp;he wore&nbsp;a crown, and Red Sox glasses in honor of his favorite baseball team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;little-known fact about Robinson is that he&nbsp;also&nbsp;participates in the&nbsp;Red Sox&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox/fans/fantasy-camps/red-sox-fantasy-camp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantasy Camp.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For now, Robinson enjoys batting practice once a week. When the weather gets warmer, he will be seen at Page Park with his beloved Mustangs.&nbsp;</p>
