<p>FARMINGTON – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball opener from Farmington high school on Wednesday, February 10 showed exactly what the local program is capable of when firing on all cylinders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing after one frame of play, the Lancers took the lead for good midway through the second quarter as Eastern eventually downed Farmington, 63-58.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern canned 11-of-19 field goals in the second frame and built a solid 12-point edge at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That edge ballooned to 19 toward the tail-end of the third tilt before the home team made a furious comeback in the fourth but got no closer than three points late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at each pass, a huge basket from Eastern standout Ciara Collins helped to increase the visitor’s lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins was impressive with a game-high 25 points to go along with five rebounds, four assists, and three steals over a busy night of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alyssa Kehler kicked in 18 points, Sage Scarritt added eight points, four rebounds, and three steals while Cali Doyon collected eight points, two rebounds, seven assists and a team-high four steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent earned her first ever start and contributed four points, two rebounds, and four assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Making their first appearances for the Lancers that night were freshmen Emma Stavens (three assists) and Audrey Tice who each made contributions to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had 21 assists on 27 baskets, moving the ball around the court with zest and finding open targets while committing just 13 turnovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington’s Emma Novajosky led the team with 21 points while Sarah Bertolette dropped in 19 for the losing contingent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led by four early in the first frame before Farmington went on a 10-2 run to settle on a 12-8 push through eight minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second period, Collins canned a quick jumper and when she cooly sank two free throws, making it a 14-12 game in Eastern’s favor, Farmington never led again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the half, Collins canned a jumper, Kehler found Parent for a basket and when Collins threaded a nifty pass to Scarritt - ending the stanza with a hoop at the buzzer - Eastern led 32-20 at the break via a 24-point second quarter scoring bonanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still leading by 12 midway the third quarter, Keller sandwiched two 3-pointers around a jumper by Collins as the program hit six of its first eight field goals to open the third period with a 42-24 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Collins 3 extended the cushion to 19 late in the third as the Kingstreeters led 51-38 with one quarter left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Farmington fourth, the home team seemingly couldn’t miss from the field, attacking the basket for hoops while going on a 20-10 run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as Eastern tried to run clock, turnovers and rushed shots got Farmington within reach of the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late three from Novajosky coupled with a lay-up and two free throws dropped the deficit to 61-58 but time was nearly up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington was forced to foul, eventually putting Collins on the line for a 1-and-1 situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She sank both free throws, Farmington never scored again as Eastern won a big 63-58 decision on the road to move to 1-0.</p>
