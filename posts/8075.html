<p>BRISTOL - After a tough one-point loss in its football opener to Bloomfield, what would the response be by the Bristol Central program against South Windsor last Friday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about another resounding effort, this time leading to a 27-0 victory over the Bobcats from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central moved to 1-1 overall while South Windsor is winless at 0-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were tremendous on defense for the second straight game as opponents are averaging just 3.5 points-per-game against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Centralâ€™s sensational Victor Rosa tallied his second, third, and fourth touchdowns of the season - helping to get his team on the scoreboard early in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa simply carved up the South Windsor defense as he made 20 blazing rushes for 239 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the fourth quarter, Rosa found Damion Glasper for a 37 yard touchdown strike as Central turned the showdown into a bit of a blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa threw just under 80 yards for a total around 320 all-purpose yards on the evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first period, Rosa scored on a five yard plunge and made it an 8-0 game when the QB found Damion Glasper for a two-point conversion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That score carried into the halftime break as the Central defense gave South Windsor fits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the third tilt, Rosa was back at it again, scoring on a three yard rush to make it 14-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the final period, the home team scored two more times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was Rosa again, sprinting into the goal - this time for 20 yards - and another TD score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the QB and Glasper made one final touchdown connection, the Rams rumbled up a 27-0 victory to draw even on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is back home on Friday, taking on Wethersfield in a big CCC bout at 6 p.m.</p>
