<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol public school system has some very good varsity cross country programs within its city limits this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Central boys program, led by outstanding senior Nate DeAngelo, is one of the elite runners in the state this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ranked 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;in a preseason poll by ct.milesplit.com, DeAngelo already established a new course record at Rockwell Park this year and has continued to improve as the season progressed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central defeated Eastern back on October 7 and, once again, DeAngelo blasted the standard at Rockwell Park.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankie Porrini, a very good sophomore, has been one of the top runners for the Rams’ program over the last two seasons as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On that same October day against the Lancers, the girls program from Central was narrowly defeated by Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Central’s program is highlighted by seniors Natalia Popielarz and Bella Crandall. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers have a trio of excellent athletes that were all in action on Wednesday, October 21 at Lewis Mills high school in a Central Connecticut Conference, Region B clash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the girls from Eastern just missed upsetting the Spartans, falling 28-31 in a tightly contested race.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Fiona Gallagher and senior Avery Braccia are an excellent one-two punch and duo finished the race against Mills in the top two spots.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gallagher won the event in 21:09 while Braccia finished as the runner up with a time of 21:56.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a solid fifth place showing, Eastern senior Sophia Andrade ended the fray in 22:36 as the Lancers came extremely close in taking the race.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the boys side, the Lancers didn’t have any problem on the course, spinning the Spartans by a 20-42 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Justin Cascio might have won the race for Lewis Mills (16:36), but it was all Bristol Eastern over the next seven spots of the event. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Dominic Tartarelli came in second place in 18:43 while Logan Crowley, a talented junior, finished in third at 18:43.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Carter Harris (18:53) earned fourth place, senior Ean Newman (19:06) was fifth, junior Dante Marciano (19:18) took sixth, senior Gabe Bartolome (19:26) ended up in seventh while sophomore Aidan Tartarelli (19:27) rounded out the top eight as the Lancers were sharp on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central travels to Plainville this Friday for a clash against the Blue Devils while hosting Lewis Mills on October 28 and finishing up against Farmington (November 4) on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern also has two road courses to tackle over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are at New Britain next Wednesday at Stanley Quarter Park, while a trip to Avon on November 4 is the last regular season meet on the docket for the program. </p>
