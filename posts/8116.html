<p>The Eastern girls swept the first two sets with little resistance, winning by scores of 25-13 and 25-18.</p>

<p>The third set was more competitive, as Coach Stefanie Reay gave her subs plenty of action, but the Lancers were still able to emerge victorious by a spread of 25-23.</p>

<p>Eastern was again led by the dominant presence of Hannah Webber at the net. Webber had 14 kills on the night, and also chipped in 5 aces. Lilli Lowe added to the Lancer attack with 3 kills and 1 assist. And Abby Jones had a tremendous night with 28 assists and 5 Digs.</p>
