<p>SOUTH WINDSOR – The Bristol Eastern baseball team cruised into the sixth inning of its CCC Interdivisional tilt against South Windsor on Monday with a lead in hand before things fell apart on the locals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bobcats ended up scoring three runs in the bottom of the sixth, handing the Lancers a tough 7-5 loss from Rotary Field in South Windsor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (1-9) lost for the ninth time in ten games while South Windsor moved to 2-7 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was another tough luck loss for the Kingstreeters as Eastern pitcher Andrew Lozier threw a complete game effort, giving his squad a solid start on the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed South Windsor just three hits and one earned run entering the bottom of the sixth, with Eastern leading 5-4, before that fateful sixth stanza nixed a possible winning effort.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bobcats collected five singles off Lozier in the sixth, notching three runs to snare a 7-5 edge which eventually led to the victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the plate, Lozier dominated once again, collecting three hits overall to pace Eastern’s 10 hit attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier tallied an RBI single in the first inning, drilled a long two-run home run over the right field fence in the fifth, and added a double in the seventh to help light up the scoreboard as Eastern put the tying run at the plate late in the seventh.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Stickels and Trevor Nohilly added two hits apiece while Jaydon Churchill dropped in a triple for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern grabbed the lead early, lost it, then regained it in a three-run fifth before the contest eventually fell apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first frame, Churchill was hit-by-pitch, stole second, and scored on Lozier's single up the middle to make it a 1-0 game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor grabbed a run in the bottom of the second stanza to tie things at 1-1 but Eastern went right back to work in the third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill tripled to left-center field and scored on a sacrifice fly by Dylan Woodsome to make it a 2-1 game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor then picked up another unearned run in the bottom of the third to tie the game again, this time at 2-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fourth, the Bobcats scored two runs off only one hit as an RBI single by Peyton West gave the home team a 4-2 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers scored three times in the fifth to snare a 5-4 edge as Lozier went back to the long ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome singled to put one on and then Lozier homered to tie the game at 4-4.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stickels followed up with a single to left and Ben D'Amato drew a walk to put two on. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Ryan Fradette sent an RBI single to left that notched a run and propelled the Lancers to a 5-4 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bobcats were blanked in the bottom of the fifth but in the sixth, South Windsor rallied for three runs – helping the home team to the eventual 7-5 victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers play a big one on Wednesday, squaring off against rival Bristol Central from Muzzy Field at 6:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
