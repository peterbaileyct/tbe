<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary will have clipped the irises that grandpa planted ages ago--Grandpa is no longer with us, but the flowers he planted and the tools he engraved with his name remain. These&nbsp;particular irises, three of them on a&nbsp;single green stalk, stand about three feet high, and reside in a flower vase on our kitchen table. The&nbsp;blossoms, as big an open hand&nbsp;and twice as large as a fist formed from my hand, attract the eye and lighten the heart—they are that beautiful. We are&nbsp;pretty lucky&nbsp;to be able to enjoy them. Thanks, Grandpa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the week, we receive video and photos featuring the grand kids, new ones, just over a year old, having been born just under two months apart,&nbsp;really closer&nbsp;since one, the&nbsp;premie, came early, which would make them about three weeks a part. The photos this week included, early in the week, one from a backyard, featuring the little one in an orange knitted hat and blue denim jumper, and on Saturday, a little one from the aquarium, in shark themed snazzy pants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the pandemic, those videos, photos and FaceTime visits kept the spirit alive. Grandpa and Grandma, who were with us until just two years ago, would have got a kick out of the babies, and Grandpa, mostly, the technology that keeps us connected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here at TBE, we are happy to see our number of followers increase, and we are excited about the future.&nbsp;Every once in a while, I am thinking, it’s a good idea to share some of our thinking and plans. Primarily, our goal is&nbsp;local coverage exclusively. Community news reporting has suffered in the past few decades, maybe longer, with owners who have, for their goal, profit rather than service. It’s no different here in Bristol. (And we can only imagine what will happen to The Hartford Courant with its sale to a hedge fund.)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is no different than many other places. Our local coverage has suffered, is suffering. So, why not a local online newspaper, TBE, which is committed to Bristol and our citizens? It’s taken some time, and&nbsp;it will take a little while longer for us to get our legs under us, but that is our mission: promoting local online journalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;At the moment, we are volunteer, solely, so anything you read has been produced from the largesse of our “staff.” Take, Mike Letendre. He is a sports marvel. His commitment to our community and to the kids and families who participate in sports is simply amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from Mike, who tracks down his stories, attends games, orchestrates coverage with coaches, our staff pretty much relies on press releases and word of mouth or, as with the Term Limits issue, what is literally dropped in our lap. Messages from the Republican Town Committee chair arrive among my texts regularly, or I find them among my emails. In addition, information is readily available online or through FOI requests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For my part, I am putting myself through a civics lesson of sorts, learning about how our local and state governments operate. You’d think with Mary on the council I would have some special insight. To a point, I consider my discussions with her to be enlightening, but I am not steeped in the work the way she is. She spends hours reading in preparation for meetings. Over the years, her knowledge base has increased exponentially.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially, our roles are different. She is on the inside, as an elected official, and I am on the outside, as a journalist. I know enough not to probe about those executive sessions; she knows enough not to divulge information. In general, we both want to make Bristol better. We just have taken different routes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At TBE, we are a work in progress. I suppose, it’s safe to say we will not be perfect, but we will attempt to do what we do, with what people and resources we have, to be accurate, fair and transparent with our reporting. If we have a bias, it will not be for political parties, but for our readers, for the people—in the sense that we will measure the success of our reporting on how it meets the needs of our community, of what works best for people, like you and me—and even, engage in some solutions journalism. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, this is complicated. People run businesses. People run the government. People run our non-profits. People are everywhere. So how to decide on what an appropriate subject for a story and what is not? Therein lies the rub. And, my best guess is, that we will be learning about this process together. I hope you are along for the journey. In many ways, we may even be redefining how community&nbsp;newspapers&nbsp;function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, keep signing up as followers on our website, sending notices about your events, sending story ideas, even thinking about volunteering—we are a teaching and learning organization.&nbsp;</p>
