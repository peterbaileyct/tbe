<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern girls tennis squad got right to work against a very strong Simsbury squad on Tuesday, April 13 in a CCC Interdivisional match from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Lancers dropped a tough 6-1 decision to the Trojans at the Bristol Eastern tennis courts, the locals put together some good showings along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lone victory for the Lancers on the afternoon came in No. 2 singles play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooke Treannie had her hands full against Simsbury’s Jenna Lee over a back-and-forth affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the junior from Eastern eventually pulled out the victory, winning by set scores of 7-6 and 10-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Trojans won the other six matches, eventually sweeping doubles action along the way.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top singles’ match, Simsbury’s Ceci Albino defeated Ashlee Lewandoski (6-0, 6-1) and at the No. 3 slot, Christina Zang won against Eastern’s Olivia Dossias, (6-1, 6-0).</p>

<p>In the final singles match, Julia Bautista defeated the Lancers’ Ava Gesner (6-0, 6-1) to help Simsbury take three of the four matches.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Trojans proved extremely tough in doubles play, allowing the locals just one set point in each of the three matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In No. 1 doubles action, Ellie McElroy and Katie Winkleblack defeated the Eastern duo of Jenna Cefaly and Brianna Kelley (6-0, 6-1).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s No. 2 doubles combination of Trisha Mohan and Adrianna Reay fell to Kate Cardinal and Devon Casale (6-1, 6-0) while in the final spot in doubles play, the Simsbury combo of Amory Dempsey and Molly Naughton turned away Gina D’Angelo and Kiana Ouellette, (6-1, 6-0) as the Trojans picked up the 6-1 victory on the road.</p>
