<p>Diaper need is defined as the lack of a sufficient supply of diapers to keep an infant or child clean, dry, and healthy. Currently, diapers are not subsidized by federal or state assistance programs such as WIC and SNAP.<br><br>Lauren Kittle, who oversees the Caring Closet commented, “1 in 3 U.S. moms report suffering from Diaper Need, which impacts the physical, mental, and economic well-being  of children and their families. Parents try to make do without diapers by stretching their supply, by leaving babies in dirty diapers longer, or by reusing diapers. Lack of diapers has a profound impact on families, including health risks like rashes and urinary tract infections for children and mental implications such as stress, anxiety, and depression for parents and children.”<br></p>
