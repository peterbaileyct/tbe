<p>Congratulations and a word of thanks to Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu and the Mayor's Opioid Task Force she created for the outstanding work <a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/mayors-opioid-task-force-video-series-wins-silver-telly-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">producing an award-winning series of public service announcements</a> that help combat the spread of opioids here in Bristol and aim to reduce the stigma of opioid misuse.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s entry was one of over 13,000 from around the country and five continents. Bristol won a Silver Telly in the Social Video Series-Health and Wellness category. Since 1979, the Telly Awards have showcased the best work from television and video for all screens.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 18-part series of short vignettes was produced by MazzMedia, a local concern, with commentary from members of the Police Department, the Bristol Burlington Health District, Bristol Hospital, now Bristol Health, the mayor and, more importantly, those affected personally by the opioid crisis.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For professionals alone to have participated would have been a service to the community. Professionals provide an important perspective to understand the scope of the opioid crisis, the devastation that it reeks on an entire community and solutions. The series would have been successful if it had been limited to this perspective.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What makes this series so powerful, however, is that it includes the brave, thoughtful and caring voices of people from our community who have been affected directly by the crush of the opioid crisis, an epidemic of a different sort, that has been with us for years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These voices remind us that opioid misuse can happen to anyone from any family, regardless of a person’s means or status. Recognizing that fact can help us all be a little more understanding and compassionate to those suffering in addiction. Not only that, acknowledgement of this reality educates us about how the answer to such an epidemic requires community resources for which we are all responsible and for which we will all benefit in the long term.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Awards are great but what is more important in this case is for as many people as possible from across the spectrum to view the videos. The longest is four minutes, the shortest just over a minute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Opioid Task Force Video Series is available by accessing:&nbsp;<a href="https://bristolallheart.com/our-community/a-recovery-friendly-community"><strong>https://bristolallheart.com/our-community/a-recovery-friendly-community</strong></a>.</p>

<p>While on the page make sure to check out the background about the City of Bristol's Recovery Alliance or COBRA initiative, which encourages recovery over punitive measures for people dealing with addiction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is another example that when the citizens of Bristol come together they are capable of making good things happen, even when the subject is as difficult and trying as the opioid crisis.</p>
