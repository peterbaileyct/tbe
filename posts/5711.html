<p>BRISTOL - With ducks on the pond and the Bristol Central baseball team attempting to stage a furious seventh inning rally, Bristol Eastern had to make some big defensive plays to close out its city series battle on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers had Andrew Lozier on the mound and the senior standout thrived - even as the pressure rose to a fevered pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Eastern defense helped close out the contest, leading the Lancers to a 3-2 victory over the Rams from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Going into this game, we knew this was going to be a close one," said Lozier. "Eastern/Central is always close but I came in and I was going to battle. In my mind, as soon as I showed up, I'm going the whole time. I want to pitch all seven [innings]. I want to beat these guys and that's what I did."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier went the distance against the Rams, posting a two run, seven hit and four strikeout gem - adding another complete game effort to his career ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I wasn't going with anyone else," said Eastern coach Steve Gaudet of Lozier. "He had two pitches left on his pitch count and he was going all the way through."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 7-13 while Central - playing for the first time since May 12 due to COVID protocol - dropped to 9-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Bunty Ray lost two starters during game play due to injuries and then had to replace starting pitcher Mike Lorenzetti on the hill via the pitch count rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams went toe-to-toe against the surging Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The first game [against Eastern], I was very upset. Tonight, and I’m not a big excuse maker, but the kids gave me everything they had,” said Ray. They’re out there, not having been out there in a long time and they’re doing what they can. But they weren’t struggling.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti was tremendous on the hill, drawing a tough loss but fanning 12 and allowing just four hits over 4.2 innings of outstanding play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only one of the hits he allowed went for extra bases and when the team need an out, Lorenzetti helped provide one via punch-out from the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The kid is coming off of, obviously, having to sit out,” said Central’s Ray of Lorenzetti. “He was tired [and] he was fatigued around the third inning. If he didn’t hit the pitch count, I would have let him work through that last inning [in the fifth] too. And every time I went out to talk to him, the conversation was ‘what do you want to do?’ He’s earned that as a senior. He wanted to stay and I didn’t see any reason to take him out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I talked to my assistants a bunch of times saying, ‘should we make a change?’ There’s something about [Lorenzetti], the look in his eye…so I figured I’d ride him out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti was perfect at the plate, going 4-for-4 with a triple and two runs scored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier picked up two strikeouts over the top of the first inning while Lorenzetti posted three straight Ks - getting his curveball over the dish - to keep it scoreless through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti started the second stanza with a blazing triple to right and scored on a grounder to short by Frank Spirito as Central nabbed a 1-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jacoby Banks then walked and when Adam Caron slapped a single to right, two men were on with just one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a 6-3 double play ended the frame as the Lancers looked to answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Fradette opened the bottom of the tilt with a blooper to short center and Eastern was in business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette then stole second and Ben D’Amato (1-for-2, RBI) dropped a short flare in left And when the ball got away from the fielder, the lead runner scored from third as the game was quickly tied at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"All these guys had great at-bats," said Lozier. "They battled and we did our thing."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Lorenzetti - through his crafty pitching - managed to strikeout the rest of the side as the game was tied 1-1 going into the third tilt of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the third, Central’s Zach Vanasse - filling in for the injured Dillon Hudson - was plunked by a pitch, later stealing second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sean Wininger drew a two-out walk and Lorenzetti beat out a infield hit to short, that took a Muzzy Field hop, as the bases were loaded for Spirito.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lozier fanned the slugger as the game remained a 1-1 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Nohilly and Tyler Martin earned base-on-balls and with one out in the bottom of the third, two runners were on for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the third straight inning, Lorenzetti struck out the side as the fourth frame commenced with both teams engulfed in a 1-1 stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central opened the fourth as Banks drew a leadoff walk and two fielder’s choices later, Mike Allan occupied first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He moved to second on a botched pickoff play, but Ring grounded out to end things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone in the bottom of the fourth, Tyler Stickels unleashed a stand-up triple to the gap in right, but Lorenzetti battled back, tallying strikeout 10 and 11 as the game remained a 1-1 contest through four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Lozier made sensational plays on two ground balls in the fifth, hustling after one and knocking down another for a 1-2-3 inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The kid goes out there and gives 110-percent to his team," said Ray of Lozier. "He fields his position. They were a couple plays that he made, not as a pitcher but as a fielder, that could have given us a few more [runners on base]."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fifth, Eastern put together its game-winning drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nohilly opened the inning with a single to left and when Jayden Churchill bunted him over to second, the Lancers had a runner in scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin reached base via infield error as two were on for Lozier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier walked to load the bases but Lorenzetti fanned Fradette for his twelfth and final strikeout of the game - ending the pitcher’s evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Mike carried us,” said Ray. “He was getting strikeouts. We didn’t have to make as many plays. The ones that we had to, we made a few [behind Lorenzetti]. Obviously, we wiggled out of some [jams]."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Spirito now on the hill for Central and the bases juiced, he walked D’Amato and Stickels for RBI tallies as the Lancers snared a 3-1 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"That was enormous, getting those couple runs to give us a little bit of breathing room," said Gaudet of the bases loaded walks. "[Central] was going to keep fighting, I knew that. We just needed to hang on."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger then came on to throw to end the threat as Central moved into the sixth trailing by a couple runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams got right back at it as Lorenzetti slapped a single down the third base line and off a grounder to Lozier, the ball was thrown low to second base, bouncing off the bag and into short right-center as two men were on with no one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fielder’s choice from Banks put runners on the corners with one out and when Caron dropped in a grounder, Lorenzetti scored from third as the Rams chopped the deficit to 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's a credit to [Ray] to get those guys even ready to play, to keep them in the game,” said Gaudet. “They battled their butts off.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allen then raced out an infield hit to shortstop and, once again, men were on first and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Ring grounded out to short to end the threat as the Lancers were hanging on by a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill drew a two-out walk in the sixth and when Martin smacked a single to right, two runners were on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk to Lozier loaded the bases but Wininger picked up a huge strikeout as Central came to bat in the seventh trailing by a 3-2 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with one gone, JT Clark dropped a base hit into left as the Rams a absolutely refused to give in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti then blasted out a two-out base hit to center and with men on the corners, Central was one hit away from trying up the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Fradette chased down a Spirito ball that was blasted to the gap in left-center to end the game as Eastern hung on to win, 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"[It] was incredible today," said Lozier of the defense. "Ryan out there in the outfield, Cole [Latko] was laying out everywhere to make plays, and everyone was going at it today and that's a team win. It really was."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after two weeks of not being able to practice fully and hit the diamond, Central showed enormous grit and determination until the final pitch was thrown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We never gave up,” said Ray. “The grit was outstanding. Obviously, we caught two injuries and two starters came out during the game. You lose [Roberto] Cruz, you lose Dylan [Hudson] and now, all of a sudden, I’m putting kids out there that haven’t really played varsity baseball. They went out and put the bat on the ball. There were a couple plays, base-running wise, that we could have just anticipated a little more.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It just didn’t go our way.”</p>
