<p>BERLIN - Berlin's Conner Gileau pitched a complete game shutout on Wednesday, leading Berlin to a 5-0 CCC South victory over Bristol Eastern from Sage Park in Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats moved to 11-3 off the victory while the Lancers dropped to 2-12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gileau allowed just two hits, walked two, and struck out 10 to earn the win for the Redcoats.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's only hits were singles by Trevor Nohilly in the third inning and Cole Latko’s base hit in the fifth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Lancers were shutout over the seven inning encounter, the Kingstreeters only real threat to score was in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infield error and Nohilly's base hit put two runners on and the duo advanced on a pop-up in foul territory that went beyond first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Gileau recorded a strikeout to end the threat – keeping the game scoreless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fifth frame, with the Redcoats in front by three, Latko advanced to second base on a groundout following his single but that rally never got off the ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin scored two runs in the third off Eastern pitcher Brayden Moore who hung tough throughout the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin’s Nick Melville (3-for-3, three singles, one run scored, three RBI) opened the third inning with&nbsp;a single to left, stole second, and scored on a base hit by Jamie Palmese to make it a 1-0 contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Palmese then swiped second, and after Moore generated two outs, Pat Lukens singled to left to score Palmese that made it a 2-0 game thought three innings of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin then added an insurance run in the fourth as Ben Schulz opened the inning with an infield single.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then stole second, and after Moore picked up two outs, Schulz scored on a base hit to left from Melville – making it a 3-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats then scooped up two additional runs in the sixth, started by a Sal Dastoli single that snuck between shortstop and third base.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dastoli then went to third on a wild pitch from Moore and a walk to Schulz eventually put runners on second and third with no outs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moore, like he did all game, tallied two outs, including a strikeout, but had to leave the contest via the pitch count rule.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Melville then singled off reliever Ryan Maglio, scoring the final two runs of the showdown, as Berlin went ahead by a 5-0 push through six completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moore pitched well in the losing cause, allowing seven singles, walking two, and striking out four.</p>
