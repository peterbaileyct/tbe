<p>The event honored Deacon Joseph Hudson Sr. who turned 100 years old. <a href="http://www.bristoledition.org/local-naacp-honors-101-year-old-joseph-hudson-sr/">Read the story here</a>. The program includes a section about Hudson and his family.</p>

<p>The program also includes a Freedom Trail grant report prepared by Hudson's late daughter Barbara Hudson. Hudson presented the findings of her grant at a Bristol Historical Society event years ago, now. It is one I attended and think about often.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The report covers the first black neighborhood of Bristol, Beacon Heights, and the legacy of James F. Snowden, first black resident of Bristol and a local landowner. The reports recommends further study and acknowledgement of the area and made their lives here.</p>

<p>In addition to these historical contributions, the program also includes a history of local NAACP prepared by Gail Williams of Plainville. Williams presented her findings at the February event, which included a dinner and a question and answer period with Deacon Hudson and his son, Joseph Jr.</p>
