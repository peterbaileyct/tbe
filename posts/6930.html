<p>When Bristol American Legion pitching standout Roberto Cruz left Post 2’s game with a 2-1 lead in hand over Tri-Town on Wednesday night, the talented chucker was about to earn his seventh victory of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been an impressive year for Cruz who suffered an injury in the last Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern baseball game during the scholastic campaign -- limiting his ability to play in the field this summer for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that hasn’t stopped him from succeeding on the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This guy is the ultimate competitor and there’s simply no quit in Cruz -- earning a remarkable 7-0 record this season to lead the Bristol program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When I need him to throw a breaking ball for a strike, he does,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Cruz. “He hits spots and he just competes real hard.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win over Tri-Town was Cruz’s final postseason game on the hill due to pitch count rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 2-1 win over Tri-Town on Wednesday night, Cruz allowed one unearned run while posting just two walks and not allowing an extra base hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Has he even allowed an earned run this season?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, Cruz’s success is augmented by a superior defensive effort behind him.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol defense has been outstanding over state tournament play with just one error committed against Tri-Town and only made three miscues overall in the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitching and defense wins games and Bristol has both of those qualities in large amounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The postseason continues today against Avon from Rotary Field in South Windsor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is at 4 p.m. (play hooky…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Tri-Town was legit</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tri-Town, the second place finisher in the Northern Division in Zone 6 this year, was a worthy second round opponent for Bristol despite its .500 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program took on all comers this season, playing a state-high tying six non-zone games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That kind of slate helps round out a program, giving the team a look at several different competitors across the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ranked 11th in state tournament play, the squad "upset" No. 6 West Hartford by a 4-0 push in first-round action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And pitcher Mason Barber played extremely well for Tri-Town in the loss at Bristol, despite drawing the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed two runs on only two hits while fanning eight over five tough innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Avon is responsible for one-third of Bristol’s losses this season</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As long as No. 3 Bristol doesn’t have to play Avon from its home field of Buckingham Park, the locals are going to have a great chance to knock off No. 7 Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon won the season series over Post 2, two-games-to-one, and outscored the locals by a 14-1 margin in those two setbacks from Buckingham Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol defeated Avon in Bristol on June 30 by a 3-1 final, and that’s the type of outcome Post 2 is hoping for tonight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Beaucar is scheduled to take the hill for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Zone 1 riding high</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the final eight teams in tournament play, three belong to Zone 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 3 Bristol joins No. 7 Avon in the North and No. 12 Newington in the South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can’t gripe about the play of Zone 1 teams because those squads are still in the thick of it in state tournament action.</p>
