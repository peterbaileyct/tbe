<p>Sunday afternoon,&nbsp;5-year-old&nbsp;Ben Fournier&nbsp;and his father,&nbsp;John,&nbsp;were at Rockwell Park enjoying the newly opened Bike Pump Track, a circuit of banked turns, berms&nbsp;and rollers&nbsp;designed for&nbsp;off-road bikes.&nbsp;Ben said his favorite part is the turns and bumps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>John, who&nbsp;grew up in Bristol&nbsp;but&nbsp;now lives in Southington, was told about the latest addition to Rockwell Park’s portfolio of&nbsp;amenities and attractions&nbsp;by his&nbsp;brother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“My brother lives up the street, so he sent me a picture, and he’s like ‘check out what they got now!’” John said.   </p>

<p>Going up and down the course and shifting his body weight from side to&nbsp;side,&nbsp;when necessary,&nbsp;Ben&nbsp;showcased his talents on the&nbsp;continuous loop&nbsp;by&nbsp;traversing through the&nbsp;swoop like&nbsp;turns&nbsp;and&nbsp;berms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to his father, Ben has&nbsp;been riding&nbsp;on a&nbsp;two-wheeler&nbsp;since he&nbsp;was&nbsp;three and&nbsp;was on training wheels for&nbsp;only&nbsp;two hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a former Bristol resident, John is impressed how the&nbsp;104-acre&nbsp;park has developed in recent years,&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Rockwell Park has come a long way,” he said.&nbsp;“It has everything&nbsp;now like&nbsp;hiking, fishing,&nbsp;skateboarding,&nbsp;swimming,&nbsp;and this&nbsp;new&nbsp;Pump Track.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben said he is looking forward to coming back&nbsp;soon to&nbsp;learn some new skills and tricks.&nbsp;</p>
