<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first day of winter scholastic sports in Bristol is a busy one as all five public school programs are in action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There might be a few opening night jitters on display but our student athletes, already delayed a day due to Tuesday’s snow storm, are ready to finally hits the courts (and pool).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look at all the games that takes place on Wednesday, February 10:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avon at Bristol Central</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium at Bristol Central</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defending CCC South Patriot Division champions, Bristol Central, has one heck of an opening season challenge against Avon (12-8 regular season in 2019).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons bring high-scoring forward Jack Hall (23 points and 10 rebounds-per-game last year) to the Charles. C. Marsh Gymnasium and he’s a problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall can do a little of everything and doesn’t need much room to launch up shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s surrounded by a very solid team who will shoot - and make - 3s which could give the Rams trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for every 3 Avon makes, Central has the ability to match that offense from long range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there’s that 7-foot-1 center in the paint that Avon doesn’t have an answer for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look for a big night out of Donovan Clingan to open up the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a very good test for Central but don’t forget, the Rams are one of the top-ten ranked teams in the state along with CCC favorites East Catholic, Windsor, and Northwest Catholic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A victory for the Rams will give Tim Barrette (140-140 overall) his first plus-.500 record in regular season play as the head coach of the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Farmington at Bristol Eastern</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium at Bristol Eastern</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington is two years removed from a state title but are still very dangerous and extremely well coached.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program ended the regular season at 15-5 and ended up defeating Eastern by a 74-60 final from Farmington high school back on December 20, 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that opening night game saw Eastern cut a double-figure deficit to six points at the half before the contest got away from the Lancers late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indians can employ a front line of at least 6-foot-2 around the horn while guard Jacob Smith (16 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists-per-game last season) is a handful as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Farmington has to deal with Eastern senior Elijah Parent (16.8 ppg) and a squad ready to finally get the regular season underway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is going to be a stern task for the Lancers but a victory isn’t out of the realm of possibility for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Girls Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central at Avon</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Avon high school, large gymnasium</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon won just seven games last season and one of those was against Central, 54-41, back on December 20, 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Rams are looking for a little payback and Central coach Steve Gaudet is ready for the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals have a little firepower to battle the Falcons with in the form of Sophia Torreso and a squad that includes Gwen Torreso, Janessa Bartell, and Ella Watson - looking to start the campaign on a winning note.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s two games in three nights for Central and after the contest against Avon, it’s a showdown against Bristol Eastern at BC for a little city series excitement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern at Farmington</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Farmington high school</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much like Avon, Farmington went 7-13 in 2019-20 while the Lancers were an 18-win program but graduated a couple starting components.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Farmington team will have its collective hands full against Eastern’s three-headed monster of Ciara Collins, Sage Scarritt, and Cali Doyon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each is capable of giving Farmington fits while it should be interesting to see who steps forward for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern plays three out of its next four games on the road before three straight home contests help to balance out the schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys Swimming/Diving</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Farmington at Bristol Central/Eastern/St. Paul Catholic</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time - </strong>3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location</strong> - Dennis Malone Aquatic Center</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defending CCC South champs start the 2021 campaign from home against Farmington from the Dennis Malone Aquatic Center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central/Eastern/St. Paul Catholic contingent went 8-2 overall last season and was 5-1 in CCC South meets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the first of four home meets for the Bristol outfit while the program competes on every Wednesday into March except for February 24.</p>
