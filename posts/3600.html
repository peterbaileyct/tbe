<p><br><strong>Sidewalk Snow Removal Ordinance and Fines</strong><br>Per City Ordinance Sec. 21-23, It is the responsibility of property owners or occupants whose property abuts a paved sidewalk to clear sidewalks of snow within twelve (12) hours after a storm if the storm ends between 3:00am and 9:00am and within nine (9) hours after a storm if the storm ends between 9:00pm and 3:00 am. <br></p>

<p>If ice forms on the sidewalk and/or wheelchair ramps, it must be removed and covered with salt and sand so it is safe for travel. Sidewalks must be cleared to a width of least four (4) feet for wheelchair access. <br><br>If sidewalks are not cleared, the Dept. of Public Works will clear sidewalks and wheelchair ramps and the cost to do so will be charged to and liened against the property owner. Any person violating the terms of this section will be fined $75 for each offense. <br></p>

<p>Residents who wish to make a sidewalk complaint should call the non-emergency phone number for the Police Department which is 860-584-3011. </p>

<p><strong><br>Snow Removal on vehicles</strong>—State Law requires operators of all motor vehicles to remove any accumulated snow/ice from the hood, truck and roof of vehicles. Failure to do so subjects drivers to a $75 fine and $200+ if the failure to do so causes personal injury or property damage.</p>

<p><br><strong>The Bristol Police Department</strong> reminds residents of these rules during weather events: Drive slow, leave early and give yourself extra time to get wherever you have to go. Leave extra distance between you and the car in front of you. Headlights should always be on during winter storms.</p>

<p><strong>City Hall&nbsp;</strong>will open at 10am on Thursday morning to allow the staff to prepare the sidewalks and entrances and to ensure office staff and residents safe entry to the building. Residents that need to visit City Hall are encouraged to call the individual office first, to insure staff availability.</p>

<p><strong>The Bristol Fire Department</strong> reminds property owners the importance of clearing fire hydrants at their property. In addition, should there be a power outage, use caution with candles, secure batteries for flashlights in advance, and when utilizing a generator, be sure it is set up properly and far enough away from the home to avoid any dangers inherent with generator use.<br></p>
