<p><strong>DeAngelo to run at Outdoor Nationals</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central distance running sensation Nate DeAngelo is heading to a major event on the West Coast in the beginning of July.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he needs a little help to get there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo will be running at the Outdoor Nationals, presented by Nike, at Hayward Field in Oregon on July 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a tremendous event, one that will help wrap up his scholastic career before heading off to UMASS Lowell – running for both the Men’s Cross Country and Track &amp; Field squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Oregon, DeAngelo is entered in the mile and the 5000-meter events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are so excited for Nate to be able to attend the meet at historic Hayward Field in Tracktown USA,” said Stafford-Kirk.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nationals meet runs from June 30 to July 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A GoFundMe page has been set up to help DeAngelo with the expenses of attending this amazing event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This meet is outside of the high school season so Nate and the coaches attending are footing the bill,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Nate has a GoFundMe set up to help defray his family’s out of pocket expenses.”</p>
