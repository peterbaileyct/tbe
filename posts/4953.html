<p>In another huge Central Connecticut Conference boys basketball Tournament engagement, the team from Bristol Central high school proved – once again – why the program is one of the elite squads in all the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams continued its trek through the abbreviated postseason with another victorious effort to remain undefeated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fourth ranked Central earned the right to take on No. 2 East Catholic in the CCC Tournament championship game as the locals defeated top-ranked Northwest Catholic by a 71-60 final from Mirabello Court at Northwest Catholic high school in West Hartford on Wednesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Central and East Catholic will enter the CCC Tournament title tilt at 14-0 overall and the outcome should decide which squad ends up No. 1 in not just the CCC in the state as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Playing on enemy soil, the Rams saw its supporting cast start the fourth period on fire and then their big guy took over to seal the deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior center Donovan Clingan put up his usual playoff numbers, posting 36 points and 27 rebounds to lead his squad over another monster effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest was physical with Clingan throughout but once the final period commenced, he made a quick hoop, and then Sean Wininger, Carson Rivoira, and the crafty Eli Rodriguez strung together some huge plays – on both sides of the ball – to stretch out the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rodriguez was simply outstanding, flipping in 10 big points which included seven over a critical eighty-three second stretch over the final quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira added his three points early in the fourth while Wininger notched his eight points over critical junctures of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Victor Rosa scored seven points off the pine, D’Ante Ross nabbed five while Damion Glasper added a hoop for the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lions ended its season at 13-1 but gave the Rams one heck of a battle through three quarters of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rhandyn Bair flashed in a team-high 18 points, Matt Curtis hit for 17 while Hayden Abdullah added 13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest was content to chuck up NBA range 3s, floaters and other shots in attempts to stay away from Clingan and his shot-blocking abilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those attempts by Northwest fell early but over the fourth and final frame, baskets were hard to come by as Central took off with the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams led wire-to-wire in the first period, saw the score change hands four times over second and third quarters of play before snaring a 15-point edge midway through the fourth period to secure the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, it all led to Central’s biggest win of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan, who entered the game hitting only one three-pointer all season long, dropped in two 3s to open the game and when he put-back an offensive rebound for a hoop, it was an 8-2 contest in Central’s favor just 1:49 into things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger hit a three late in the quarter but a basket from Northwest’s Jehyvic Spencer closed the deficit to two before a couple charity tosses by Clingan – who scored 14 points over the first eight minutes of the game – made it a 19-15 contest in Central’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lions used a 9-2 run, capped by free throws from Curtis, to open the second quarter as the Rams trailed 24-21 with 3:16 left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central scored eight of the final 10 points in the second as Wininger canned a 3, as did Rosa, and when Clingan put in a hoop with seven second left, the Rams led 29-26 at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, the visitors ran out to a 35-27 edge as a sweet hook shot and two free throws from Clingan made it an eight-point affair with 6:11 to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Northwest remained in the mix, scoring points on Central turnovers, and when Curtis cashed in a steal for a lay-up, the home team scooped up a 42-40 edge with 2:57 remaining in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A floater from Justin Ashberry gave the Lions a three-point lead late but Rodriguez drained a 3 to tie the game and when Clingan beat the buzzer with a lay-up, Central never trailed again – scooping up a 48-46 lead with one quarter to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two free throws from Curtis with 5:38 remaining trimmed the deficit back to two again (53-51) but time ran out on the Lions as Rodriguez heated up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carson found Rodriguez for a 3 and off a steal, the guard banked in a basket as Central nabbed a 58-51 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Carson put home a lay-up, a Rodriguez steal put him at the line and after two free throws with 4:12 to play, the Rams’ cushion reached 62-51.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan eventually took over, scoring seven points over a 9-2 Central jaunt and when the center scored one final hoop with 2:03 left, the game was all but over as the Rams were in charge by a 71-56 push – eventually winning the showdown by eleven.</p>
