<p>Since the American Legion of Connecticut decided not to run a state-wide baseball program this year due to Covid 19, the Bristol Legion team opted to enter a one-year agreement to play in the Connecticut Elite Baseball Association, said Paul LaFleur, team consultant, who has been with the Legion program for years in different capacities. </p>
