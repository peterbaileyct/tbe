<p>The City of Bristol Department of Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services is seeking nominations for the departmentâ€™s 30th Annual Youth Recognition Awards, which spotlights and celebrates young people who are going above and beyond in service to the Bristol community. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Youth and youth groups may be nominated by adults that benefited from a community service project or volunteerism of a Bristol young person. The 30th Anniversary of the awards comes at a unique time during the Covid-19 Pandemic, which has been a challenge for our youth over the last two years to accumulate the required number of hours.</p>
