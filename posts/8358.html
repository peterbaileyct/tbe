<p>It’s been a tough start but against Edwin O. Smith on Friday afternoon, the Lancers battled the program to a halftime stalemate.</p>

<p>But the Panthers scored a goal late in the fray to eventually topple the Lancers by a 1-0 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>

<p>Smith improved to 3-3-1 overall while the Lancers, so close to a tie, fell to 2-5.</p>

<p>With 6:14 left in the showdown against the school from Storrs, Nicholas Simpson hit a hard shot from the top of the goal area, zipping the ball into the Lancers’ net to notch the winning tally.</p>

<p>"We battled throughout and just missed some chances," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp;"It was an evenly played match, other than the goal.&nbsp; We had three corners in the last five minutes but just couldn't connect."</p>

<p>Panthers’ keeper Aiden Dagata made six saves as did Eastern's Carlos Portillo.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over Eastern’s next three matches, the locals will be on the road for stern challenges.</p>

<p>The Lancers travel to Bristol Central on Tuesday for a 5:15 p.m. showdown, the opening bout in a huge BC/BE doubleheader from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
