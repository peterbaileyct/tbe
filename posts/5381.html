<p>Come Sunday morning, the weather will have been turned so that Saturday was one for the books, a bit chilly but shining sun and bright blue skies, perfect for the opening of Little League, spring clean-up at Pine Lake and a commemorative tree planting on the Boulevard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year’s Little League ceremonies were chunked up into three separate ones, sensibly, to accommodate CDC requirements during the coronavirus pandemic—yes, we are still in one, and yes, things are looking better. Let’s keep at it! As for the ceremonies, TBE contributing editor Rit Carter, who coaches in the league,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/little-league-holds-opening-ceremonies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grabbed a few quick photos,</a>&nbsp;which were posted. We are looking forward to following Little League games and posting game results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spring clean-up at Pine Lake follows last week’s city-wide spring clean-up. Volunteer groups popped up all over town with their trash bags and rakes, bright yellow shirts, masks and sun hats. At Pine Lake, it was more of the same, but volunteering was limited to members of the Pine Lake Commission, who have for their goal making things pleasant for the upcoming 7th Annual Kids’ Fishing Derby. I stopped by to say hello and grab a few photos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the four volunteers was Bob Cummiskey, a life-long&nbsp;Bristolite, who wondered why he had not met me before—since my wife, Mary, is the council liaison to the commission. Mary was among the volunteers, as was Bob’s wife, Jane. The&nbsp;Cummiskeys&nbsp;were cleaning up the flower beds, which Bob, proudly informed me had been installed a few years ago by local Boy Scouts. We covered a few topics, including Malone Pond, across the street from Pine Lake, and a place where some of us swam as kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>John&nbsp;Gianoni, commission chair, was&nbsp;helping out, too, pacing himself since he was recovering from some work on his shoulder. John and I already know each other, since our kids went to school together. We chatted about his daughter, who married another friend of the Fortier family, and together run a soccer concern for kids out West. Things are booming, John said, now that things are loosening up and parents are looking to get their kids outdoors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The commemorative tree planting on Memorial Boulevard brought out an old friend, Lee McFadden, her entire family, and a contingent of the members of the local Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) chapter. The group had taken up for its cause replacing one of the pin oaks commemorating a&nbsp;Bristolite&nbsp;lost in WW I.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each pin oak on the stretch of the boulevard between Mellen and Main streets memorializes&nbsp;Bristolites&nbsp;lost in that war. The ceremony, against the background of motorbikes and decked out vehicles, was both solemn and fun, including digging the hole and plopping the tree in it with the appropriate watering. See a few photos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/dar-plants-memorial-tree-to-fill-void-on-boulevard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And a commercial moment—TBE (bristoledition.org)--is a hyper local operation: we are all Bristol, all the time, and we are expanding every chance we get, but it’s important to mention how much fun it is to get together for our weekend “staff” meeting, when Rit Carter and Jack Krampitz start in on sports. Between them (and of course throw Mike Letendre into the mix) there are years and years of coaching, both volunteer and otherwise, that have affected umpteen kids (generations of them). And the stories. Well, I wish you could be there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, there were a few more Bristol moments. At Chunky Tomato, while picking up one of their Irish pizzas—a real treat—I noticed a photo featuring, Keith, who has been with Chunky for years, promoting him, since he had earned a realtors license;&nbsp;and who should greet me but Kaylie (Kaylie, I hope I spelled that correctly), who, after I asked her where she has been, informed me that she was close to finishing school so that she could start a career cutting hair. Looks like some people have been busy during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention the president’s address on Tuesday, one day before his 100th day&nbsp;in office, not only because it is history, but as a reminder that his programs and policies affect us here in town. Funds, arriving shortly, for the state and city will be&nbsp;helping out&nbsp;small businesses as well as public projects. In addition, it’s worth mentioning that for the first time, two women flanked the president as he delivered his address. The money is important, of course, yet that picture may set a tone that is just as important, if not more important, to young and old among us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, it’s time to start planning the next week.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until then, be well.&nbsp;</p>
