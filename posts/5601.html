<p>BERLIN - The Bristol Eastern girls tennis team gave Berlin a real run for its money on Wednesday in a CCC South tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Redcoats were able to fend off the Lancers, snaring a 5-2 victory from the tennis courts at Berlin high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss dropped the Lancers to 4-10 overall while the Redcoats improved to 9-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s two top players won their matches for the visiting aggression as the team did what it could to stay in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In No. 1 singles play, Eastern’s Brooke Treannie and Berlin’s Katy Sparmer exchanged 6-4 set scores – forcing a third-set tiebreaker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Treannie roped up a 10-7 win to take her match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the second singles slot, it was Brianna Kelley’s turn to step up for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kelley snared the win via set scores of 6-4 and 6-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Ava Gesner (No. 3 singles) fell to Berlin’s Bri Calafiore by consecutive scores of 6-3 and 6-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then to wrap up singles play, the Lancers’ Trisha Mohan fell to Ana Cardona over set scores of 6-1 and 6-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in doubles action, it was all Redcoats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top doubles match, the team of Victoria Pietrucha and Maddie Palmese defeated Ashlee Lewandoski and Jenna Cefaly but needed three sets to earn the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All tied up at 1-1, the Berlin duo took their match via a 10-8 third-set win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the second doubles match, Berlin’s Emily Wishiewski and Susan Wishiewski swept Eastern’s combination of Adrianna Reay and Olivia Dossias (6-0, 6-0).</p>
