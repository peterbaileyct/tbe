<p>BRISTOL – When the Bristol Central football team squared off against Wethersfield on Friday night, it was big measuring stick for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles entered the contest at 2-0 while the Rams (1-1) were looking for their second consecutive victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, it was Central who came away with a tremendous win in a CCC Tier 2/3 crossover showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams, off the power of speedster Victor Rosa, never let Wethersfield in the contest as the Rams scooped up an impressive 28-18 win from the turf field from Bristol Central high school.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa helped his squad to two early touchdowns as the locals nabbed a 16-0 push ten minutes into play - never looking back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The UCONN bound Rosa notched TD scores off rushes of five, 16, 36 and 10 yards to keep Wethersfield at bay. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Rosa tallied 240 yards on 26 carries which included his four touchdown jaunts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After getting bottled up by Bloomfield in week one of the scholastic season, Rosa has been absolutely on fire as of late.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over his last two games, Rosa has carried the pigskin 46 ties for 479 yards and seven rushing touchdowns.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s defense has been tremendous this year, allowing just 25 points over its first three weeks of play (8.3 points-per-game) and hope to continue that trend with a CCC Tier 3 encounter at Farmington next Friday night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is at 6 p.m. from the high school’s turf field in Farmington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The victory over Wethersfield keeps Central in the Class L playoff mix. Currently, the Rams sit in 12<sup>th</sup> place with its 2-1 ledger. The program is looking to get back to the state tournament for the first time since 1987. In the Class MM championship contest that year, Central was shutout by Middletown, 27-0. &nbsp;</p>
