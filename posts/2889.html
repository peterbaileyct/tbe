<p>Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu and the Superintendent of the Bristol Water Department, Robert Longo, have announced a change in water restrictions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Effective Tuesday, Sept. 22, the City of Bristol has a mandatory water restriction policy for all city property owners, according to a press release from the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city's water supply has dropped to below 60 percent capacity during the long drought the central Connecticut area has endured. As a result, the previous policy of voluntary odd-even outside water use has been changed to a mandatory policy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have an address with an even number, you can water your lawn or flowers, wash the car, or use water outside for any other purpose on even-numbered days on the calendar. If you have an address with an odd number, you can use water outside on odd-number days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People who violate the policy are possibly subject to the termination of water service. If you have any questions, you can contact the Bristol Water<br>and Sewer Department at 860-582-7431.</p>
