<p>The number of in-person voters grew to 18,623 as of 6 p.m., according to unofficial figures from Democratic Deputy Registrar Tracy Beland in her latest update.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add that total to 9,838 absentee ballots and the unofficial number of ballots is 28,461, which means 76.5 percent of Bristolâ€™s 37,196 eligible voters have cast ballots two hours before the polls close at 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Absentee ballots will be accepted until then, as will registrations that meet the proper requirements: a proper photo ID and proof of residency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Absentee ballots received today will be counted Wednesday.</p>
