<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SOUTH WINDSOR - The end analysis of the season for the 2021 Bristol American Legion baseball team is certainly a positive one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 19-7 overall, the Zone 1 champs (15-5) left it all on the table this year as the combination of players from Bristol Central, Bristol Eastern, the collegiate ranks along with St. Paul Catholic’s Owen Davis and Zach Rinkavage from Terryville nearly helped Post 2 to a twenty-win campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>COVID mucked up Bristol’s chances at a berth in the Northeast Regional as Post 2 somehow missed out on the one-time-only Regional Qualifier but was a high seed in the single elimination postseason state tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What stings was No.3 Bristol was eliminated from postseason play via a 1-0 loss to eventual state champion, No. 7 Avon, on August 5 from Rotary Field in South Windsor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Post 2 deserved a better playoff fate than the way everything went down.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s just a shame with the COVID and everything this format of one-and-done. You shouldn’t lose your season after one game,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta about the postseason. “We played great. It’s always been double elimination [for state tournament play] but because of the COVID [doo-doo] they went to this format.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Avon game was an epic challenge that saw the two squads combine for four total hits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol defense was off the chain with Rinkavage playing a clean third base, Evan Bouchard dominating at shortstop and Andrew Lozier always a force at second.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late double-play chance came and went in the top of the seventh for Bristol, setting up the game-winning RBI single by Avon’s Matt Leopold.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I told the guys I’m real proud of them,” said LaPenta to his team after the Avon loss. “We got screwed out of the [Regional] tiebreaker, but we came back, won the zone, had a good seed, had a nice run and they made it a real enjoyable summer for me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Losing pitcher Matt Beaucar (5-2) was sensational against Avon, allowing just two hits, walking two and fanning two as he was on fire midway through the venture.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He retired ten straight batters going into the seventh inning as Beaucar was nearly light’s out over a complete game effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He pitched awesome,” said LaPenta of Beaucar. “Not only that, but he pitched on [the previous] Sunday, a couple innings [at Simsbury]. Then he came in and closed a real pressure game last night [against Tri-Town], even though he threw only 10 pitches, it’s still mentally taxing. He just threw a great game. [Avon] just pushed one across and we didn’t. That’s just the way it goes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s disappointing but at the same time, I’m really proud of them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while it looked like Avon dominated Bristol this season, winning three of four encounters, that was hardly the case.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The amateur eye saw a 10-1 loss at Avon June 15 but the realization was several players were playing severely out-of-position for Bristol and pitcher Dylan Woodsome was in it – keeping it a 2-1 game though three completed innings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was just a 3-1 contest heading into the bottom of the sixth before things fell apart.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the rematch from Muzzy Field on June 30, Beaucar threw a 90-pitch gem as Avon was limited to four hits over a 3-1 loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar was at in again on July 26 in the rubber match between the squads and Avon led just 1-0 going into the bottom of the sixth stanza.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 201 managed to defeat Bristol by a 4-0 final that day but, again, all four contests between the programs were extremely close. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of Zone 1 play, Post 2 dropped its first game of the season to West Hartford, 4-3, and had to play catch-up until the middle of the year when Bristol finally captured first place. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off a tough 4-2 loss to Naugatuck on June 19, it was all Post 2 from there as the locals went on a hot streak.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol won 11 of 12 Zone 1 games to take the division with a nifty 15-5 ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden ended up in second place at 12-5, going deep into the Regional Qualifier, while West Hartford ended the regular season at 12-7 – tied with Avon for third place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, 19-7 was an impressive ledger by Post 2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They won 19 and only lost seven,” said LaPenta. “I told them I consider them as an extension of my family. This year was all good kids. Nobody complained about playing time, about where they were playing, [and] everybody just showed up and played hard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the players that are eligible to return come back for the 2022 campaign, Post 2 has the bulk of its pitching back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier, Mike Lorenzetti, Roberto Cruz (7-0), Alex Canzellarini and Beaucar are big guns from the hill that could be in the mix once again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a big deal while some of the collegiate players that played for Bristol will factor out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 had tremendous seasons from leadoff hitter Austin Brown, Bouchard, Jack Kozikowski, and Rinkavage while Adam Caron, Ryan Fradette, Tyler Martin, Trevor Nohilly, Tyler Stickels, and Dylan Woodsome all made gains throughout the summer months.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I get a big chunk of them back,” said LaPenta. “We should have a solid team next year. [We’ll] pick up a few more guys next year. We’re losing some big keys, but the core guys are still coming back [including] all my pitchers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We should be in good shape next summer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COVID could not derail the 2021 season</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coach LaPenta was very thankful for the season as the Connecticut American Legion campaign could have been derailed by the pandemic once again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the boys from Bristol represented the Mum City at the highest level and played extremely well from start to finish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s been a really enjoyable season after COVID and everything,’ said LaPenta. “When we get on the field, it’s like you kind of forget about the whole COVID mess.&nbsp;At least coming to the park with these guys and being on the field, you kind of forget all about that for a couple hours which has been nice.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a good group of kids. I’ve enjoyed being around them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
