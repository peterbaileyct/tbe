<p>How difficult is it to win a state championship in scholastic cross country?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running isn’t just a sport where conditioning is paramount but cross country is a huge mental challenge as well - proving titles are tough to come by.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On both a team and individual front, only two squads from Bristol have won a cross country championship as the feat is a rare accomplishment in the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boys cross country championships have been awarded by the CIAC since 1932 when the program from Hartford Public won the first ever Boys Connecticut State Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when it comes to winners from Bristol - including individual and team championships - only an elite group of harriers from the city have won it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On an individual front, Bristol high school’s Don Wilde took home the Individual Open Championship in 1957, earning first place in a time of 13:25.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilde’s time was the fastest since Public’s Edward Lemieux won the Open in 13:14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And starting in 1958, the CIAC held Class L, M, and S championship races along with the usual Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an unexpected finish in 1967, the boys cross country team from Bristol Eastern did not win its class but - under the leadership of head coach Johnie M. Floyd - the Lancers took the Connecticut State Open, the only team from Bristol ever to win that event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul’s Terry Perrault won the individual Class M Championship in 1978 (15:03) and the program from Bristol Central was the Class L runner-up in both 2018 and 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in 2010, the boys team from Bristol Central, led by head coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk, was an extremely talented group of harriers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Saturday, October 30, Central stormed Wickham Park - taking on a stacked field of teams at the Class L championship event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were a highly skilled group that season, and a possible title finish was in the cards with all the athletes Central had hitting the courses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations in the preseason were high, the regular season ended with a sixth consecutive CCC South title for the program, and at the class championship, Central was off to an outstanding start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four Central runners finished in the top 14 spots at the Class L race and quickly, a title bid was in the works for the CCC South champs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the end, the Rams easily won the Class L title, defeating runner-up Darien by 15 points (71-86).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When thinking about that crew, they definitely set the standard for Bristol Central cross country and the teams that have come after them,” said Stafford-Kirk when reflecting about that championship squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Darien, who had won the Class MM championship the previous year, was bumped up to Class L in 2010 and was an excellent squad that pushed the Rams to the brink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after an excellent fourth place finish the season before at the Class L championships, Central’s scoring core of Michael Duprey, Jacob Eschner, Connor Kelley, Ethan Washburn, and Jake Mancini - all returning from that outstanding 2009 program - worked even harder to put themselves on the doorstep of a state title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when everything clicked at Wickham Park, the Bristol Central boys cross country team had its first state title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next few days, The Bristol Edition will take a look at the 2010 Class L cross country champs - getting special insight from Stafford-Kirk - while running down the regular season the Rams simply dominated from start to finish.</p>
