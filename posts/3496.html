<p>The Connecticut High School Coaches Association released its 2020 Cross Country All-State teams on Wednesday as 170 athletes were honored around the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that grouping included several runners from the Bristol area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central seniors Nate DeAngelo and Natalia Popielarz, along with sophomore Frankie Porrini, earned All-State nods after a tremendous season for the Rams program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Congrats to Bristol Central Cross Country runners Nate DeAngelo, Frankie Porrini and Natalia Popielarz,” said Central cross country coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk on Twitter. “We are so proud of you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the Bristol Eastern side, junior Fiona Gallagher also tallied All-State honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It certainly was a strange cross country season with a shortened campaign and only one postseason event though runners from Central had another meet at the 12th Rock Northeast HS Club Cross Country Championships last Saturday from Montgomery, New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo had a tremendous final campaign for Central - taking first place during regular season meets - and made a fantastic showing in New York with a 27th place finish with a time of 16:15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was easily the best runner in all of Region B, winning the championship race on November 10 in 15:42 while capturing his personal record of 15:31 on October 21 in a Central victory over New Britain - also from Stanley Quarter Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo established a course record at Rockwell Park on October 1 as his time of 16:33.7 was an amazing way to open the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then came another personal record of 16:22.2 in a meet against Southington on October 14 before establishing a new course standard - this time at Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the meet at Winding Trails, Central turned away Farmington behind the senior’s new standard of 16:33.7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just about every week, DeAngelo seemed to be breaking a record or challenging an existing standard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Porrini, the ever-improving sophomore, made his finish at the CCC Region B meet in New Britain a personal showcase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini took fourth at the championship meet, crossing the line in 16:28 as he improved his time by forty seconds from the last time he ran at Stanley Quarter Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finished under 17:10 three times this season and then had an amazing showing in New York last Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini’s time of 16:43.4 was the fourth best time in the No. 1 seeded tilt to end the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In regular season meets for Central this year, Porrini usually finished in second or third place. The best is yet to come for this outstanding runner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Popielarz finished her final season strongly, cashing in a third place finish at the Region B race in 19:30.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was a polished runner in the regular season as well, posting a 19:39 against New Britain on October 21 - with no other runner in sight - while opening the season against Avon with a first place finish of 21:42.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in her final regular season meet, Popielarz won the Farmington challenge in 20:13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She finished in 21:05.8 for second place on October 14 versus Southington and had a strong appearance in New York to end her scholastic cross country career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Gallagher, another talented harrier from the Bristol Eastern program, had an excellent season as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After coming in fourth against Farmington, Gallagher took either first and second places finishes the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She clocked in at 21:09 against Lewis Mills on October 21 but after that meet, Gallagher’s times never reached twenty-one minutes again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her personal best came against New Britain on October 28 (20:10), earning second place against Avon (20:12.6), and then became only the second girl from the Bristol Eastern cross country team to earn All-State honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gallagher ended her junior campaign taking sixth place in 20:52 at the Region B Championship.</p>
