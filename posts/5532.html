<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol boys lacrosse team, made up of the best and brightest players from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern, carry a 4-2 ledger to date - playing extremely well this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 12-4 win over Wolcott to start the campaign on April 19, it would be over two weeks before the locals hit the turf again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol fell to Lewis Mills (20-7) on May 6 and one day later, the BC/BE squad were 16-1 winners against the Rockville/Coventry/Stafford co-op.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Monday, May 10, Bristol defeated Edwin O. Smith by a 10-6 final from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol coach Logan Geller gave a detailed report of the match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol 10, Edwin O. Smith 6 - May 10</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a high-powered offensive matchup, the Bristol Co-op boys lacrosse team came out victorious, topping E.O. Smith by four goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boys from Bristol looked poised from the first whistle and found their offensive rhythm early in the showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jeffrey Taillon led the offense with two highlight reel goals while the rest of the scoring was scattered throughout the line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>X Attack-men Mason Coco made the offense run smoothly while adding another goal to the scoring ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Aidan Collins also got in on the scoring action with some sound finishing and Andrew Beaulieu , D’Andre Wiggins, and Nathan Shorette served as complimentary offensive x-factors,” said Geller.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Jakub Warszawik played extremely well, scooping up five ground balls.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Stavens also led the defense throughout the game, recording a season high six caused turnovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Dylan Brown and Somaneen Kheav held down the fort for the Bristol defense and were extremely successful clearing on the night,” said Geller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol moved to 3-1 after the convincing CCC South win.<br>The following day against Wethersfield, Bristol fell by a 16-5 final but this past Thursday, the locals got right back to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Middletown, the Bristol Co-op brought their shooting mitts for their match, defeating the Blue Dragons by a 16-5 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol 16, Middletown 5 - May 13</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was able to flex its offensive muscles as Max Stavens absolutely took over in cage with a save percentage of over 65-percent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Bristol crew tied its season high with 16 goals over a romp of Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Andrew Spina led the offense with a stunning opening goal and impressive eight points,” said Geller. “Jeffrey Taillon was able to slice through the Middletown defensive midfield, recording five goals and adding two assists. Dylan Brown was a commanding force on the wings and led the team in ground balls.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Geller was left impressed by the Bristol defense, limiting Middletown to just the five goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was incredible to see the defensive unit led by Jack Stavens, Jakub Warszawik, and Somaneen Kheav,” said Geller. “D’Andre Wiggins also brought out his face dig to score two beautiful goals. The unit really seems to be clicking as they crush their win total from the past few seasons.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, once again, Geller sees a bright future down the road for the Bristol program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, Bristol will see action four times - starting with a showdown against Canton on Monday from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time commences at 6 p.m.</p>
