<p>In a joint release announcing the grants, Bristol Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu and New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart encourage local businesses and nonprofits to explore the requirements of new CARES Small Business Business Grant Program and to apply as soon as possible, since the funds are limited and being among the first to complete an application is critical.</p>

<p>Online applications are scheduled to be accepted beginning the week of Nov. 9, with all funds distributed by Dec. 30.</p>

<p>The new program is designed to help qualifying small businesses and nonprofits that have been impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic and related downturn, according to the release.</p>

<p>The Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) will administer the one-time grants, which can be used for expenses including payroll, rent, utilities, inventory, machinery or equipment purchases, or the costs of compliance with State pandemic reopening guidelines.</p>

<p>The grants will be paid for with $50 million from the state’s Coronavirus Relief Fund, which utilizes federal CARES Act funding. The governor is directing the DECD to commit half of the funds to small businesses and nonprofits that are located in towns and cities designated as <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DECD/Content/About_DECD/Research-and-Publications/02_Review_Publications/Distressed-Municipalities">distressed municipalities</a>. </p>

<p>Updated annually, the Distressed Municipalities list identifies the State’s most fiscally and economically distressed municipalities and are used by state agencies to target funds for needs which may include housing, insurance, open space, brownfield remediation and economic development programs, among others. Both Bristol and New Britain are on the 2020 list.</p>
