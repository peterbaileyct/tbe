<p>A free Bristol writing workshop, operating under the umbrella of the City Arts and Culture Commission,&nbsp;is seeking eight participants to begin in September. The goal of the workshop is to provide Bristol residents with an opportunity to write for publication. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I will be leading the workshop.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants must be at least 18 years old (possibly 16 or 17 with a parent or guardian’s&nbsp;permission) and must have transportation to and from the workshop venue.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The workshop will be comprised of eight two-hours sessions that meet weekly on Tuesdays, Sept. 3 to Oct. 29. A final session will be a Nov. 2 reading that is open to the public. </p>

<p>By the end of the workshop, each writer will have produced at least one piece for publication in an anthology that will be available in digital and print format. In addition, all participants will have discovered their own personal writing habit for future writing projects.&nbsp;</p>
