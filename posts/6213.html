<p>SIMSBURY – After the Bristol American Legion baseball team earned a trip to the pay window on Thursday – shutting out Simsbury over a 10-0 mercy-ruled victory – Post 2 moved to 3-3 in Zone 1 play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a critical triumph for Bristol as the program is about to embark in its most important portion of the schedule to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming week, Post 2 plays on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday in four huge Zone 1 confrontations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sunday sees West Hartford travel to Bristol (1 p.m.) while the following Tuesday, Post 2 squares off against Berlin from Sage Park at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon then travels to Bristol on Wednesday while Thursday sees Meriden invade Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time for each of those events is 5:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a big stretch,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “We have to make some hay in those next four games.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford was undefeated in Zone 1 play until dropping a tough 4-3 decision to Avon last Wednesday from Hall high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon led 4-0 in that contest and never looked back despite a gallant comeback by West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As things stand in Zone 1 today, West Hartford is in first place at 4-1 with Avon just a half-game behind (3-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck and surprising Meriden are both 3-2 – one game back in the Zone 1 hunt – while Post 2 is in the mix at 3-3, just 1.5 games out of first place in a very crowded field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We got to .500 in the zone,” said LaPenta off the Simsbury win. “We saw West Hartford got beat [against Avon]. We’ll play them Sunday.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give credit to Bristol’s Andrew Lozier who went all six innings against Simsbury on the mound, throwing 95 pitches and allowing just two hits over a shutout effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta had Roberto Cruz warming up in the bullpen early in the sixth inning, but the chucker was not called upon in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz will be ready this week if Bristol decides to throw him on the mound, last pitching – and winning – against Newington in Bristol’s 5-3 victory last Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Sunday, LaPenta is going to turn to his hired gun on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol will be going to Michael Lorenzetti in his second start of the year against West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After allowing just two hits in a tough 4-2 loss to Naugatuck the previous Sunday, the big man is ready to go in hopes of starting the busy week off with a Bristol victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lorenzetti is going to pitch,” said LaPenta. “Hopefully, we’ll have a good outing, get a few runs, and get a ‘W.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The West Hartford showdown is the biggest game to date for Bristol</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even as the season has yet to reach its midpoint, the challenge against West Hartford on Sunday is a must-win showdown for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s going to be huge,” said LaPenta of the West Hartford challenge. “They’re going to be a top team in the zone.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A critical goal for Bristol this season is to finish in one of the top two slots of the Zone 1 standings and a berth into the regional qualifier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting into the regional qualifier would help Bristol avoid the murky play-in round which is tough for even top teams to win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why the game against West Hartford the second time around (Post 2 lost at West Hartford 4-3 to open the season) is a must get.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the middle of July, the first and second place team in each zone goes to play what they’re calling a regional qualifier,” said LaPenta. “Those two teams go and if you win that, you go onto the Regionals. If you don’t make it, the top five teams play in just a regular straight tournament.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting to the pay window against West Hartford also ensures that Bristol has a chance to win the season-series against the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Bristol can win each series against every Zone 1 opponent this year, the road to the postseason becomes much easier to navigate through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Obviously, it’s a huge game,” said LaPenta of West Hartford. “It’s also a huge game because I told the guys we have to win two out of three [against every team]. If you win two out of three, you’re going to be in a good spot against everybody and we already lost once to [West Hartford].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got to win that one.”</p>
