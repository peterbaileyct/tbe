<p>This year, the Bristol Farmers Market is shifting to the other sideof Hope Street, which will accommodate the many returning vendors along with new ones. In addition, the new location will allow for dedicated areas for the free musical entertainment and a food truck area with picnic tables and corn hole games for customers to enjoy after they shop. Parking is available in the new City parking lot at Centre Square and on North Main Street or on Riverside Avenue. Additional parking is also available at the Bristol Health Medical Center with access from Hope Street. Parking and the entrance to the market is accessible from Hope Street.</p>

<p>“The Farmers Market&nbsp;not only&nbsp;fills a much needed access point to healthy food for Bristol and surrounding communities, but is also an opportunity for the City to showcase the potential of what Centre Square has to offer those who visit, work, and live in the downtown area,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo Sassu. “Each week the Farmers Market&nbsp;attracts&nbsp;up to 1,000 people to the downtown area where they can shop for healthy food and locally-made products and then stay to enjoy food and drink from local businesses – whether it be from the food trucks at the market or the restaurants and two breweries in the area.”</p>

<p>“The addition of a mural at Centre Square&nbsp;transforms an empty wall space&nbsp;through public art&nbsp;to the downtown area,”&nbsp;stated Lindsay Vigue, Chair of the City Arts &amp; Culture Commission. “Our hope is that this colorful mural will be enjoyed by the community when they utilize the new parking lot and the walking path that connects it to Main Street as they visit and patronize the downtown businesses and the weekly Farmers Market.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Farmers Market will offer products ranging&nbsp;from farm fresh vegetables, fruits and products from local farms; to hand-made beef jerky; to baked goods;&nbsp;coffee;&nbsp;maple syrup;&nbsp;beer;&nbsp;craft spirits;organic snacks;&nbsp;and other locally-produced products. Some new additions to this year’s market will be&nbsp;Better Half Brewing, offering&nbsp;their canned beer and 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Day Nutraceuticals, offering&nbsp;natural remedies for allergies, inflammation, hydration, and immunity.</p>

<p>“We are happy to welcome back vendors from previous seasons and excited to welcome new vendors as well. Providing a dedicated area for customers to enjoy food, free musical entertainment, and a game of corn&nbsp;hole&nbsp;after shopping is an exciting new addition&nbsp;to the market&nbsp;this year,” stated Dawn Nielsen, Marketing &amp; Public Relations Specialist for the City of Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
