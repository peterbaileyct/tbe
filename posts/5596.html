<p><br>“The free program is sponsored from a grant through the United States Department of Agriculture and is being handled now through Foodshare. The boxes include meat products, vegetables, and dairy products like yogurt, cheese and milk,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. This is the last Farmers to Families food box under this program. <br></p>

<p>The Mayor’s Office and United Way are continuing to work on the details for food distributions over the summer, which will include working with a different distribution partner. </p>

<p>The pallets of food boxes will be unloaded from the trucks and divided with volunteers at each station. The line of cars will be directed into drive-thru lines where the food will be placed into the back seat or trunk of each vehicle. The entire distribution is contact-less and adheres to all&nbsp;Covid&nbsp;precautions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traffic should follow signage from Middle Street to Cross Street to Vincent P. Kelly Rd, following the traffic pattern developed by the Traffic division. Those coming for the food boxes should also be aware of increased traffic in the Lake Avenue and Middle Street area since Lake&nbsp;Compounce&nbsp;is opening on Saturday.</p>
