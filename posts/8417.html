<p><strong><em>Two runners representing Bristol will include the Bristol Farmers Market on their route as they run the Boston Marathon “virtually” this year.</em></strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The October 9 Bristol Farmers Market will feature two runners who are participating in the “Virtual” Boston Marathon this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Adam Levine</strong>, a Bristol resident and respiratory therapist at Hartford Hospital, will be participating in his fourth marathon, which has included the Hartford Marathon twice and the Newport Marathon once. Adam plans to start the 26.2 mile route at his home in Bristol, passing by the Bristol Farmers Market around 12:15 p.m., then by Bristol Hospital and then another 23 miles through the streets of Bristol, Farmington, West Hartford, and Hartford before ending at the entrance to Hartford Hospital. Adam is dedicating his run to the patients that have lost their lives this past year to COVID-19.</p>

<p>“It has been a lifelong dream to run in the Boston Marathon. This year I am living the dream virtually to raise money for Hartford Hospital’s COVID-19 Fund in honor of the lives lost and to salute my colleagues’ hard work during the pandemic,” stated Adam Levine, Respiratory Therapist at Hartford Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Mary Etter</strong>, Executive Director of Bristol Adult Resource Center (BARC) will also be running through the Bristol Farmers Market at 10:45 am on October 9. Mary will be running on behalf of the individuals served at BARC and the BARC staff. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary decided to run the virtual marathon as both a fundraiser and awareness builder for BARC which has been dedicated to assisting individuals with developmental disabilities and promoting their personal growth and community inclusion since 1957. Because of the tremendous support of the community, Mary has increased her original goal of raising $2,500 to $5,000 which will be used to fund programs at BARC.</p>

<p>“A marathon is 26.2 miles…it’s hard work!&nbsp;I’ve done four half-marathons, but I’ve&nbsp;never done a full marathon before.&nbsp;Because the staff and individuals at BARC inspire me so much every day, I&nbsp;look forward to&nbsp;attempting this ambitious goal! I will be running past BARC’s group homes so that the individuals we serve can cheer me on,” stated Mary Etter, Executive Director of BARC.</p>
