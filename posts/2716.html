<p><strong>Jacob Santiago, </strong>the starting catcher for Bristol Central High, is finishing up his senior summer of baseball with Team Connecticut Baseball, where he has participated since he was 12. Due to the Covid virus his travel to North Carolina, New Hampshire and among others has been cut short, but he is grateful he got a summer season playing teams throughout the New England. The NCAA has yet to cancel spring college spring sports. He will be heading to the University of Hartford Aug. 24 to continue his baseball career, fingers crossed.  </p>
