<p>Following the lead of the CIAC, NECBL and American Legion baseball programs, which all canceled their respective seasons, Bristol’s three little league programs (Edgewood, Forestville and McCabe-Waters) are the latest local baseball institutions to cancel their season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With heavy hearts and great disappointment, the leagues began announcing via their websites and Facebook pages the cancelation of their 2020 spring season for all levels of play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sighting safety concerns for the players, volunteers, fans and parents alike, the leagues opted to table the season.</p>

<p>The McCabe-Waters Board of Directors addressed the issue with the McCabe-Waters families on their website:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This decision did not come easy or without sadness.&nbsp; Little League is more than just a place to learn how to play baseball.&nbsp; It is friendship, it is family, it is community.&nbsp; We have been holding our hope that in some way we would be able to get a season in for our kids.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we do not believe that we safely move forward with team activities under the current guidelines put forth by the state of Connecticut.”</p>

<p>Incidentally, another casualty of Covid-19 is the City Series, which will not be played for the first time since 1984.&nbsp; This is a double elimination tournament between the champions of the three leagues to crown the city’s best Major’s Division baseball team that began in 1956.</p>
