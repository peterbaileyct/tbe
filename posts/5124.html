<p>BRISTOL - As several area squads were getting to the pay window on Wednesday, so was the girls lacrosse squad from Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program wrangled up a dozen-and-a-half goals in a huge 18-5 victory over Enfield in a CCC South showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match was played from the turf field at Bristol Central since Eastern’s all-weather surface was not ready for the start of spring sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was leading by an 8-5 push at the half and then went on a 10-0 run over the remaining periods to ice the match.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offense came in many forms for the Lancers as Vanessa Drury led the charge with five goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Eastern, Emma Stavens and Ciara Collins – Bristol Eastern’s most recent 1,000-point scorer in girls hoops – each tallied four goals as the scoring came pouring in off a great effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins and Stavens dominated on the draw and Lucy Winiarski was solid defensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an excellent bounce-back win as two days previous, the Eastern squad fell to Newington, 17-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are 1-1 on the young campaign.</p>
