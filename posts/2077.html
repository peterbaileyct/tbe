<p>This week, "Ten Minutes" features Andrew Wood, an educator and family friend. Andrew and I talked Sunday, May 31, over the phone. As with most educators, he is working from home. In Wood's case, however, he is working with K-5 students, and he is teaching Physical Education, an activity with its own unique challenges.</p>
