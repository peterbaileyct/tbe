<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 9, the Connecticut High School Coaches Association announced its 2020 All-State Girls Volleyball teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voting for the squads was concluded on December 5 and by the time all the counts were made, four players from Bristol were named to the first and second squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the Class L First Team, Bristol Eastern’s Zoe Lowe and Leah Chipman made the list while, Central’s Emily Ericson was also named to the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Ryley Plourde earned CHSCA Class L Second Team All State honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all four seniors did Bristol scholastic volleyball extremely proud as the teams combined to lose just two matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lowe had one heck of a scholastic career, smashing down over 1,000 kills with 170 of those coming over a condensed 2020 season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it all wasn’t front line play as Lowe also collected 126 digs, 50-plus aces, and even chipped in 21 assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She shined in the postseason with 24 kills against Avon and added another 16 against Farmington to close out her career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On October 15, Lowe rained down a career-high 15 aces versus Plainville while tallying 15-plus digs in four matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in Eastern’s final contest against Central this season, Lowe bumped up five assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last two regular seasons, Eastern was undefeated and Lowe’s power game was a huge part of that success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the third straight year Lowe made the All-State team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She earned second team honors as a sophomore while taking home the first team award as a junior and senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To put it mildly, Florida Southern University is getting a multi-talented, highly skilled, intelligent athlete that could even moonlight on the school’s softball squad if she wanted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman directed traffic with the best setters in the state during 2020 - angling up 401 assists and did a little of everything for the Eastern program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s been outstanding over her four seasons which saw the senior finish her scholastic career with a CCC Region B title and 1,233 career assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman also compiled 72 digs and improved her serving, adding 26 aces to the till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also added 11 kills this season, posting three of those in two different matches while zipping in five aces in the playoff game against Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipman had two matches of 11 digs and averaged over nine assists-per-set this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had three matches of 41-plus assists with a season best 48 coming in that postseason war with Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South All-Conference setter in 2019 is going to help out a colligate program next season as she’s looking at schools from Connecticut, New Jersey and beyond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ericson, the excellent outside hitter from Central, is a four year varsity performer and easily led the team in kills with 203 - an average of 4.2 kills-per-set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also collected 30 aces, 10 blocks, and 82 digs as the senior had a big season for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ericson compiled 529 kills over her last three scholastic campaigns and totaled nearly 300 digs over that same stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had 23-plus kills in three matches including a 25-kill gem in Central’s first challenge against Avon on October 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ericson also dropped a season-high six aces on the Falcons in that first Avon showdown, blocked three shots against Eastern the second time around and had four matches of double-figure dig totals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s volleyball in her blood and any collegiate program would be pleased as punch to have Ericson on its roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on the All State second team, the well-spoken Plourde was one of the reason’s why the Lancers’ program went 13-0 this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The middle hitter zipped up 114 kills and was a tough defender at the net on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plourde added 19 aces, was second on the squad in blocks with 14, and zipped up 18 digs over another very busy campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her 18-kill game in the rematch against Central was a season best, while she nabbed four double-figure kill totals over her final scholastic matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plourde added six aces in Eastern’s postseason win against Avon while rejecting three shots against that very same squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In two matches against Central, she tallied 10 total digs.</p>
