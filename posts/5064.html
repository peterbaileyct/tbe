<p>The City of Bristol’s Public Works Department has released its schedule for the 2021 spring paving program which will be completed in two phases.</p>

<p> “The initial phase consists of milling off the existing pavement of the road,” said Public Works Director Raymond Rogozinski. “The second phase consists of installing a new roadway surface and will commence shortly after the first phase.  Once construction is complete, the City will repair any affected driveway aprons.”</p>

<p>“In addition to the spring paving program, the Bayberry and Surrey Drive neighborhood will undergo reconstruction of the roadways surfaces,” said Councilwoman Brittany Barney. “This process is much more involved and residents&nbsp;on those two streets&nbsp;will receive a separate notice outlining the extensive work this road reconstruction entails.
