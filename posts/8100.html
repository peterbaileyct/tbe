<p>The Bristol Exchange Club and the Mum Festival Committee are also proud to announce the return of the Mum Festival Parade on Sunday, September 26 th, at 1:30 p.m..

<p>“Due to the construction projects on Memorial Boulevard and to accommodate the Mum Festival’s move to downtown Bristol, we have revamped the parade route for this year,” said Dianna Tack, Mum Festival Parade Chair. “The new route has also been shortened by approximately one mile and will avoid Memorial Boulevard and officially end on North Main Street just before Center Street.&nbsp; Our Grand Reviewing Stand location will be on Main Street adjacent to the Barnes Group and Bikers Edge, and spectators should avoid North Main Street past the Post Office, as that is the official end of the performing portion of the parade.”&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>“For 2021, the parade will start on Race Street, turn left on West Street, left on South Street, left on Main Street, Left on Riverside Ave. Ext., right on Hope Street and then right on North Main Street,” continued Tack. “We are very excited to be able to bring the parade back this year, and we wanted to make sure the public is informed of all the<br>changes so they can plan accordingly. So please help us spread the word”.</p>
