<p>BRISTOL – Heading into a busy week of action, the softball squad from Bristol Eastern started things off in the right direction with a 10-6 victory over Edwin O. Smith on Monday in a CCC Interdivisional showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored a combined eight runs over the first and third innings as the Kingstreeters moved to 4-3 overall while the Panthers evened their ledger at 4-4.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers offense belted Edwin O. Smith pitching for 14 hits as multiple Eastern batters found a groove offensively. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Samantha Policki and Alex Shorette each dropped in three hits to lead the Eastern offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policki also added a run and two RBI while Shorette tallied a run and an RBI as both hitters were 3-of-4 from the dish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Gonzalez went 2-of-3 overall, scoring a team-high three runs, while smashing out a triple, and pitcher Ali Tellier was 2-of-4 from the leadoff spot in the Eastern line-up that included two runs and two RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riley Giblin, Jazmyn Browne, Ashley Serafin, and Makayla Antunes all grabbed a hit for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier roped up her fourth victory on the hill, allowing eight hits while collecting eight strikeouts to keep the Panthers’ hitters at bay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jenna Moore blasted out two doubles while Anna Fiore nabbed a home run to pace the Edwin O. Smith offensive attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An error allowed the Panthers a run over the first inning of play but after Tellier struck out the final two batters she faced, the Lancers got to work offensively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policki, Giblin and Shorette all posted RBI singles to give Eastern a 3-1 push after one completed frame of work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in the third tilt, the Panthers tallied another run but the Lancers nabbed five of their own to salt the thing away.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin added an RBI single, as did Policki, while Tellier’s base hit netted two RBI and through three innings, Eastern was in control – leading 8-2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez roped out her three-base hit in the bottom of the fourth while Browne’s sacrifice bunt scored the lead runner as Eastern grabbed a 9-2 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith added a run in the top of the fifth but in the bottom of the sixth, Eastern got that run back when Browne crossed home plate, propelling the Lancers to a 10-3 lead with three outs left in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers scored three times in the seventh to dent the final deficit but off one final strikeout from Tellier, Eastern won a big 10-6 decision to start the week off on a winning note.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Wednesday, Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern tangle in a city series war on King Street at 3:45 p.m. that should be a dandy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Lancers are in a double dip on Friday against Farmington from Tunxis Mead Park with games commencing at 4 and 6 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
