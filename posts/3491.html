<p>The Mayor’s Office, United Way, and FoodShare worked together to offer<br>another Farmers to Families Produce Distribution program this Saturday, December 5th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Distribution will take place from 10AM-Noon.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Due to the extreme weather forecast, the location has been changed to the Public Works Yard. Traffic must enter from Cross Street (off of 229) and head west, following the traffic pattern and signage developed by the Traffic division which will lead you to Lake Avenue and then Vincent P. Kelley Rd.</strong><br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The free program is sponsored from a grant through the United States Department of Agriculture and is being handled now through Foodshare. </p>

<p>"The boxes include meat products, vegetables, and dairy products like yogurt, cheese and milk,” stated Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. </p>

<p>“The boxes are large, so we also encourage people to share with a neighbor or family members to ensure nothing goes to waste,” said Donna Osuch, President of the United Way. "There are 1,000 boxes this week, so we are encouraging those who need it the most to come through. We reserve the<br>right to limit boxes so we can have maximum households receive something. If you have multiple households in one car, we will try to accommodate people to the best of our ability.”<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pallets of food boxes will be unloaded from the trucks and divided with volunteers at each station. The line of cars will be directed into drive-thru lines where the food will be placed into the back seat or trunk of each vehicle. The entire distribution is contact-less and adheres to all Covid precautions. . The distribution event is rain or shine. </p>

<p>“We strongly ask that people NOT arrive early,” said Police Chief Brian Gould. “That negatively impacts our ability to set up and negatively impacts the area businesses.”</p>
