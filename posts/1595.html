 The author's great grandmother was among those who died in Bristol during the 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic. Of note: her last name is misspelled due to an error by the monument mason and the date of death is incorrect because when her children paid for and erected the stone ten years after her passing, they did not know the date of death.
