<p>Last night in front of an enthusiastic crowd at the Bristol Historical Society, The Democratic Town Committee made their official endorsements for city offices, including the Mayor, City Council, Board of Education, and Board of Assessment Appeals.</p>

<p>At the top of the ticket, Ellen Zoppo-Sassu, who is chasing her third term as mayor, was heartily endorsed.&nbsp; Addressing the crowd and reflecting on the resiliency of the city, she touted her accomplishments, “This is the time for Bristol, where we not only look at today, tomorrow, next week, next year- but five years from now, ten years from now, and literally leave our community in a better place than anybody could have anticipated. Our theme is progress you can see. We are Democrats. &nbsp;We don’t just fix for today. We fix for the future.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
