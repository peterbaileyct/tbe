<p>Both teams' defenses led the way. The Eastern backline, led by Grace D'Amato (17 saves), and defenders Kate Kozikowski, Audra Porowski, Cecelia Gilbert, and Mikayla Gonzalez were active all game long and stifled any high quality chances. <br>The Farmington defense did the same, led by Margaret Huelin in goal, with 7 saves.</p>

<p>The Lancers had an edge in the midfield, led by Ciara Collins, Emma Stavens, Taigan Parent and Emily Nelson. The best chance of the first half was by Ciara Collins as she penetrated through the Farmington defense and into the box. As she attacked the goal she was clipped but battled to stay on her feet and no call was made.</p>

<p>In the 49th minute of play, a broken play saw the ball land at Alyssa Huntley's feet and she took care of the rest. She slotted a shot that just beat D'Amato and turned out to be the lone score of the game. <br></p>

<p>It was the last contest for Bristol Eastern seniors Kate Kozikowski, Lili Morneault and Annabella Lusitani. Coach Scott Redman commented,"The three seniors have left the program in a better place than when they came in, and we can't ask for anything more than that. I am extremely happy that they were able to play this season as I witnessed the heartache of not being able to play sports in the Spring.  These young ladies took advantage of every day they had together and relished the opportunity to compete."<br><br>Shots on Goal: FHS-23 (18 on goal).    BE-13 (6 on goal)<br>Saves: FHS, Margaret Huelin-6.      BE, Grace D'Amato-17<br>Records:  FHS 10-3-1.     BE 5-7-1</p>
