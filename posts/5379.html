<p>MIDDLETOWN - Friday was an exciting day for scholastic running in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the first time since the pandemic gripped our world, the state held its first track invitational as the Third Connecticut Distance Festival from Xavier high school in Middletown commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an exciting day of running as the meet saw several top runners compete over a couple grueling events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central sent a small contingent of athletes that included senior standout Nate DeAngelo, sophomore Frankie Porrini and senior Bella Bosco.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And each athlete saw success on a very spring-like day in Connecticut which included wind, a little rain, the cold, and the like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meet was a distance affair only, meaning the 1600 and 5000 meter events were the only ones that commenced from Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was all sorts of buzz for DeAngelo in the boys 5000 meter event. And the senior, one of the top 5000 runners in the state, was more than ready for the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo battled Xavier’s Brody Santagata until the finish but the standout from Bristol made a huge surge late to win the race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He crossed the finish line in 15:33.38 which was a second better than Santagata to snare the championship in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nate showed just how tough he is last night,” said Central boys track &amp; field coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “He was challenged all race by Santagata from Xavier but showed his toughness with a 64 second final lap and out kicked him for the win!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 1600 meters, Porrini was a top-12 finisher as he nabbed 11th place in the mile event with time of 4:32.31.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 1600 meters for the girls, Bosco also made a very good showing - taking 30th place overall in 5:41.49.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was windy and cold but our crew really stepped up and ran strong times at this point in the season,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Bella is one tough runner. This was her first 1600 of the season but she held on for a big personal record. Frankie continues to impress with his strength and speed. He is one of the top young runners in Connecticut.”</p>
