<p>"It was ugly, how about that."  The first words out of Coach Tim Barrette afterward described what a dogfight the Rams had with Southington High School Wednesday night. "We struggled early, allowing Southington to dictate the pace of the game." </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Knights surrounded Central center Donovan Clingan with three defenders most of the night, and Clingan seldom had any chance to make a move. Every time he touched the ball, Southington’s defenders came at him from all sides.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central only led by a score of 18-15 at half time, with Clingan scoring just seven points in the first sixteen minutes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams were equal to the challenge and came out strong in the third stanza.</p>
