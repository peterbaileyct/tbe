<h5><br>Celebrating its 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary in 2021, the Men &amp; Boys' Fund was established&nbsp;at&nbsp;MSCF&nbsp;by a group of local, committed men&nbsp;who were concerned about the specific,&nbsp;critical&nbsp;needs of men and boys that are not being met.&nbsp;The goal of the&nbsp;grantmaking program&nbsp;is to provide funds for programs that&nbsp;make it possible for men and boys to improve the quality of their lives, increase self-sufficiency and make a positive difference in their community.&nbsp;Since 2016,&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;$23,000 has been awarded in program grants from the Men &amp; Boys’ Fund, while&nbsp;over&nbsp;$5,500&nbsp;has been awarded from the Men &amp; Boys’ Immediate Response Fund to assist local men and boys who are in need of immediate financial assistance.&nbsp;</h5>
