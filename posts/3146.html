<p>Both sides had excellent chances to score in the final ten minutes as Nate Diloreto, Eastern's goalie, had to make a diving save of a Blue Knight penalty kick.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Then Eastern's Dylan Piazza sent a head ball across the face of the Southington net, but no Lancer was there to knock home a goal.</p>

<p>"Our back line was sharp again, led by Nate who also had a few other eye-catching saves,"&nbsp; said Lancer coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp; "But our offense struggled to find any rhythm."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diloreto made&nbsp;8 saves, while Southington's Ryan Lunn had 4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
