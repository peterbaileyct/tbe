Three Bristol natives, two of them living here and one residing in Florida, are in negotiations with a London label to re-release original songs they wrote, performed and produced in the 1970s.

Stanley O’Donnell, Dave Watson and John Cyr are talking to Roual Galloway.

“He is a collector of old soul songs and albums,” Cyr said about Galloway. “Half of his store is soul music.”

On LinkedIn, Galloway is director of Love Vinyl DRS Ltd, London, a start-up. Galloway is also associated with Cordial Records, a retail store.

One of the reasons Galloway is interested in O’Donnell and Watson’s music is because they wrote original soul songs that have gained a following in Europe, Cyr added.

Cyr represents O'Donnell and Watson, who perform under the stage name Ricky Aaron.

All three are friends who began playing together in the 1960s with RBB &amp; Co. and afterwards in another band, Motown Review.

Aside from representing his friends, Cyr is a musician and audio engineer. The work on the re-releases is being done in Cyr's Bristol studio, Cyreous Music.

Cyr recently returned to Bristol, from Oregon, just as things started getting interesting, O’Donnell said. Watson resides in Florida but is often in the state. O'Donnell has resided in Bristol since his touring days ended.

Cyr said he has been emailing back and forth with Galloway. As the negotiations develop he said he envisions a trip to London.

The conversation began around the 45 single vinyl records that have developed a following, with some collectors paying as much as $600, $700 or more for one, O'Donnell said.

Among the titles Galloway would like to repress for worldwide sales are the following:

“Say What’s on Your Mind,” “For the Love of Music,” “Save the World, Parts 1 and 2,” “The Dream” and “Hey, Girl.”

The artists will record new versions of some older songs, too.

“Hey, Girl,” for instance is available in an 80s version, O'Donnell said, but "it is too hoppity hop.”

“The original," he said, "it’s kick ass.”

O’Donnell said there are at least 20 more songs waiting to be cut.

About the originals, O’Donnell said, “It’s a different type of sound than was out in the 70s and 60s. If you listen to it you understand. It is different. And it captured this guy’s attention big time.”
