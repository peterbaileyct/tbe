<p>The Bristol Edition premieres its new podcast, "10 Minutes" with this brief interview featuring Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. The conversation took place yesterday, April 16, over the phone, between meetings. The goal was to stick to 10 minutes but went a few minutes longer with addition of an intro and some music.  Let us know what you think. And of course, please send suggestions for people you would like to hear from.</p>
