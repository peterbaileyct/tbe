<p>How close did the Bristol American Legion Baseball senior schedule follow the original slate of games?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With rain and the usual tomfoolery that the summer brings, things don’t always go according to plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But at least over its first twenty days or so to start the campaign, Bristol got most of its games in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at the summer that was for the Bristol American Legion Baseball squad and the games that weren’t - starting in the month of June:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thursday, June 10: </strong>Bristol did indeed go to West Hartford as Albert Molina (6 IP, 6 hits, no decision) pitched his only game the squad in a 4-3 loss from Hall high school. Austin Brown and Adam Caron had two hits apiece over the losing effort.</p>

<p><strong>Friday, June 11: </strong>South Windsor came to Muzzy Field for a non-zone challenge, falling to Post 2 by a 7-1 final. Matt Beaucar earned his first win behind a five inning, 63-pitch effort. Ryan Fradette added a big double to pace the victors.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, June 12: </strong>The original schedule did not have Wallingford coming to Bristol for an exhibition showdown. In this one, Roberto Cruz&nbsp; (7-0) threw a two-hit shutout as the locals were 1-0 winners. Jack Kozikowski tallied the game-winning RBI via an infield hit.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sunday, June 13</strong>: The contest against Berlin from Muzzy Field was postponed. It was weird to see Berlin 0-9 after nine games (Post 2 was 8-4 over that same period) this year. But as Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta knew, that winless streak would not last.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, June 15: </strong>With just about every player out of position, Bristol fell at Avon 10-1 in an error filled affair. Dylan Woodsome threw a strong 3.1 innings before things fell apart. Brown led the charge with two hits and a sacrifice bunt.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, June 17: </strong>Andrew Lozier had a strong game from the hill as Bristol spun Meriden by a 6-3 final from Legion Field. Beaucar saved the game while Kozikowski scooped up two singles, two RBI, two stolen bases and a walk.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, June 19: </strong>In a game that ultimately cost Post 2 a shot at the Regional Qualifier, Bristol fell at home to Naugatuck by a 4-2 final. Mike Lorenzetti (4.2 IP) drew a tough loss. He fanned eight while Kozikowski smacked out a late RBI single.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sunday, June 20</strong>: After scoring three runs in the first inning, Newington made a huge comeback to tie the contest at 3-3 though seven frames. Bristol scored two runs in the top of the eighth and Cruz needed just 11 pitches to win the contest as Post 2 won 5-3 from Legends Field. It was the first of five straight victories for Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thursday, June 24: </strong>After a three-day layoff, Lozier threw a two-hit, six-inning gem as the chucker helped to shutout Simsbury 10-0 in a mercy ruled game from Memorial Field. Post 84 did not win a game this summer. Incredible…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saturday, June 26: </strong>When three players came for the Southington American Legion Baseball tryout, the program decided to fold. That meant Post 2 would be three games short in 2021 as Zone 1 played every opponent three times this year. With Berlin falling flat out of the gate, Simsbury winless, and Southington not fielding a team, it was a bizarre year for Zone 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sunday, June 27: </strong>Lorenzetti pitched a strong game against West Hartford in Bristol but Alex Canzellarini earned the win on just five pitches as Post 2 was a 4-3 winner - slitting the season series at 1-1. Bristol notched four runs in the seventh to steal the game. Fradette’s two-RBI single sealed the victory for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuesday, June 29: </strong>It was Cruz again as Bristol shutout Berlin 6-0 in a contest from Sage Park in Berlin. Cruz allowed just five hits over his complete game, 101-pitch effort. Kozikowski had two hits and three RBI while Lozier popped out a three-base hit to lead Bristol. Tyler Martin and Caron (two hits apiece) zipped up half of Post 2’s eight total hits that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wednesday, June 30: </strong>Beaucar was absolutely tremendous against Avon from Muzzy Field, wrapping up a complete game, four hit gem against the future state champs as Post 2 was a 3-1 winner. Avon committed five errors that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s a wrap from June as Post 2 played most of it scheduled games with little interruption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The schedule flowed nicely with just the Berlin postponement, the add-in of Wallingford and the cancellation of the Southington game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, we’ll look at the month of July-August and how Bristol - due to the weather - did not have a chance in following the schedule.</p>
