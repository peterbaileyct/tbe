<p>The Central Connecticut Conference is going to have a postseason experience for all the Boys Swimming &amp; Diving programs and that means the Bristol co-op, made up of all three high schools in town, will be in action to end the winter campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Times and locations are still being considered but there are some elements of the postseason already in place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dual meets will be scheduled during the week of March 22 and the competition will either be in person or virtual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CCC dual meets will be permitted in person during the pandemic as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diving will need to be held during the dual meet, provided the local health department approves the type of event offered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams will be able to schedule an in person dual meet with a team outside of its region, provided both schools agree.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The league does not want any of its programs to be left without a dual meet option but should a situation arise, a virtual tri-meet would be permitted by the CCC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other elements to this postseason experience are still being planned and the best place to find out all the current information about the postseason is at <a href="http://www.centralconnecticutconference.org.%0d">www.centralconnecticutconference.org.</a></p>
