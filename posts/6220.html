<p>It was the perfect setting since the outstanding shooting guard will be suiting up for the men’s basketball program there.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a rare opportunity that we get to do a signing like this one,” said Bristol Eastern principal Michael Higgins. “When I first learned [about this], I congratulated Elijah…and I believe I said to him ‘had I worked as hard as you did in high school, this is the opportunity I would have wanted for myself.’ He worked, I think, harder than I did as a student here. I’ve seen him in the top tier classes, I’ve seen him competing fiercely on our courts and our fields, and I’ve basically seen him do all the right things to set himself up for a really, really unique and wonderful situation.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The United States Coast Guard Academy is one of the top colleges in the nation and its Naval Academy Preparatory School in Newport, Rhode Island will help the talented Parent get ready for life as an Academy Cadet in the first step of what will be an epic journey.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s little doubt that Parent is prepared for the adventure as he’s a model student-athlete from Bristol Eastern – ready for any challenge which comes his way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Having him in class and seeing him work and seeing him out on the field and in the [gym], it’s a testament to [his] hard work,” said Eastern social studies teacher and athletic coordinator John Stavens. “I’m proud of him.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, Parent is one of future leaders of our nation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His intelligence, guile, and determination will help the United States prepare for the many challenges that lie ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while he’s preparing himself for an amazing career, why not hit a couple three-pointers along the way?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Your non-stop work, non-stop everything” said Eastern boys basketball Bunty Ray to Parent at the signing. “But more important were your academics. You didn’t get in there because of basketball. He got in there because of the kind of student you are, what kind of person you are. That to me is very, very impressive. This is a top-tier school that just doesn’t take everybody.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Another thing is you’re going to be serving your country which is even more admirable.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The United States Coast Guard Academy has an array of men’s sport programs, and the basketball team has a roster of players that are from Florida, Texas, Hawaii, and even a 6-foot-5 center via Alaska.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But outside of basketball, service to country is an admirable endeavor – one Parent will perform to his fullest extent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re going to get recognition for a lot of different things but being a veteran and being a part of the Armed Forces is definitely just as special,” said Ray.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once he’s done with prep school, he’s off to the Academy and that’s when the real fun begins.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent is a young man who will tackle challenges head on and expect some amazing contributions from this outstanding individual – on and off the court – by the time he’s emersed in the entire Coast Guard experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you go in, and you’re going to have tough times, and you’re going to wonder ‘what did I do,’ but you’ll have enough to draw back on,” said Ray. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the signing ceremony, TBE caught up with the outstanding young man, talking about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity Parent is about to embark on:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TBE</strong>: “So what are you more afraid of: All the calisthenics you’re going to have to perform every morning or the extended three-point line in college?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Elijah Parent</strong>: “[Laughs] Definitely not the three-point line. I’ve been practicing for a while so I’m probably pretty good.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TBE</strong>: “What does this mean to you, being able to serve your country while getting your education at the same time? Some people just go to college, but you have this dual role here, really three roles, because you’re going to earn a degree, play a little basketball and serve your country…&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parent</strong>: “It’s just an amazing opportunity. I get to serve my country, I get to build bonds with people that will last a lifetime. And a little bonus [is] I get to play a little basketball all along the way. I get paid, I get a job…basically setting me up for my whole life. I’m just glad I get to take a part of it.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TBE</strong>: “You looked at other schools as well. You could have just played basketball and earned a degree. What stood out the United States Coast Guard Academy?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parent</strong>: “I really think I fit in there. I feel like I really thrive when there’s structure and that’s one thing they have there. Some of the things I hear is you won’t see people that you graduated with for many years. And you’ll come back and it’s like you never left each other.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TBE</strong>: “What is your major going to be at the academy?”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parent</strong>: “There are a couple of majors to choose from and I ending up choosing Civil Engineering. I really don’t know too much about engineering exactly but I’m excited to learn.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TBE</strong>: “Is there some sort of mandatory service for the Coast Guard?”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parent</strong>: “I’ll do a year of prep school and then I go to the Academy for four years, get all my education and everything. And then you have to mandatory serve for five years and then you choose to stay after, you can choose to leave, and I think if you stay, you can work for eleven more years, and I can end up retiring with a pension and all the benefits.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TBE</strong>: “What are you bringing as a basketball player to the Coast Guard Academy?”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parent</strong>: “I think I’m very talented in my opinion, that’s how I always see myself. I’m a hard worker. I’m always playing basketball. At home, I’ve got a court in my backyard. I’m always shooting any time I can get into the [Bristol Armory]. I’m in there. I’m always trying to put work in. I think the biggest asset I have is the hard work I put into the game.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TBE</strong>: “How exciting is this adventure going to be for you?”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parent</strong>: “It’s very exciting. Obviously, I’m going to have to put in a lot of work. There’s going to be times where I want to quit but I can’t give in to that. I’m going to have to keep pushing through and know it will all be worth it in the end.”&nbsp;</p>
