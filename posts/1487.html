<p>Jack Krampitz and David Fortier discuss two topics during this 24 minute podcast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first has to do with the recommendations of the Charter Revision Commission's recommendations for this year's ballot. 2019 is a municipal election year. We vote Tuesday, November 5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second has to do with Memorial Boulevard Intradistrict Magnet Arts School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Admittedly, the conversation is not the most riveting, but it is important to have an idea what is happening with these two initiatives. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the charter commission's work is approved by the city council. The magnet arts school is under the aegis of the board of education.</p>

<p>Typically, charter revisions are considered every two years. In the discussion, Fortier refers to Krampitz's involvement the last time around--this is Krampitz's second time around on the commission. </p>

<p>More information about the commission's work can be found on the <a href="http://www.bristolct.gov/AgendaCenter/Charter-Revision-Commission-22/">City of Bristol website</a>. </p>

<p>The intradistrict arts magnet school is moving ahead with the goal of meetings a 2022 deadline. Board of education committees, which meet regularly, are close to approving building plans and programs for students. More information is available on the <a href="https://www.bristolct.gov/1002/Memorial-Blvd-Intradistrict-Arts-Magnet-">website </a>dedicated to the project.</p>
