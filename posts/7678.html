<p>At Monday afternoon's meeting of the ECD Downtown subcommittee, the possibility of locating a carousel in the Centre Square property on parcel 4 was introduced to the group.</p>

<p>Morgan Urgo, the Executive Director of the New England Carousel Museum, presented the idea to the committee as something deserving of consideration.</p>

<p>Ms. Urgo has been in contact with the owner of an existing carousel currently in storage in Ohio, a carousel with a very interesting history. The carousel was built in 1903 in Pennsylvania by the Muller brothers, two people considered akin to the Ruth and Gehrig of carousel animal carvers. Carousels were huge attractions at the end of the 19th century, and their carousel was no exception.</p>

<p>It was used in the early 1900's in Island Park, Pennsylvania, and then in Oakland Park, Pennsylvania, until it was brought to Bushnell Park in Hartford in 1933. It remained in Bushnell Park until 1990, when it was  dismantled and bought by the current owner. He was unsuccessful in finding a buyer to his liking, so for the past 30+ years the carousel has been sitting in storage in Ohio. It is not just any storage facility, as it is climate controlled and dust free.</p>

<p>The committee discussed the fact that Bristol was always looking to preserve a "gathering space" for the people of Bristol to use for many purposes. One of those purposes is the highly successful farmers market that occurs every Saturday morning from May until October. The parcel where the farmers market is held is parcel 4, and it is there that the idea for a "gathering space" is envisioned.</p>

<p>Several members remarked that a carousel would be perfect for such a place, as it would be a magnet to bring children and their families to downtown. But caution was also expressed, as the committee will have to balance the cost of buying and moving and setting up the carousel with the allure of the attraction. The space requirements of the entire building with the carousel in it was also a concern, but Ms. Urgo and Economic Development Director Justin Malley assured the committee it would not take up too much space on the parcel.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far as cost, that has yet to be determined, but the owner is asking for $675,000.00 for the structure. The other costs are still being researched, but they would include moving it from Ohio, building a structure to house it, constructing it on the site, and the cost of maintaining such an attraction.</p>

<p>As far as the carousel itself, it would be different than the standard carousels frequently seen in amusement parks. There would certainly be more than circling horses, as the Muller brothers put 48 different animals on the ride. There are mules, rabbits, a zebra, donkeys tigers, lions, bears, and many more. It is very possible that parents might hear their youngster chanting, "Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my," stealing a line from The Wizard of Oz, as they exit the ride.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would also come with two separate organs for the music that would provide a larger variety of songs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a meeting of the full ECD Committee tonight at 5:00 in the City Council chambers, where the idea will be discussed further. No decision is imminent, but there is certainly interest in such a project.</p>
