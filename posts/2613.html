<p>The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC) announced Friday its plan for the fall high school sports season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All sports will have abbreviated schedules, starting later and ending earlier.&nbsp;Football teams will play a six-game schedule, followed by a two-game “playoff” schedule in which all teams will participate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the other fall sports teams will play 12-game schedules, again followed by a “playoff” schedule where all teams will be given extra games to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The start of practice for all teams except football is Aug. 27.&nbsp;At that time coaches are expected to cohort their student-athletes in groups of 15 for practices that are primarily conditioning and some individual skill work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Football can begin meeting on Aug. 17, but the first few days are for distributing equipment, reviewing play books and discussing locker room and safety requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first day of full team practice is Sept. 11, and the first contests of the season can occur on Sept. 24.&nbsp;The last day for regular season contests is Oct. 30 (29 for cross country).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned earlier, in what the CIAC calls “the Tourney Experience,” all teams will be eligible to&nbsp;play extra contests starting on Nov. 2 and continuing to Nov. 15.&nbsp; The format for the contests will be announced later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern high schools that means the season there will not be the traditional Thanksgiving Day game, since the season ends earlier than usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of the contests the teams participate in will be scheduled regionally, cutting down on long road trips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fan attendance will be determined by local school districts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CIAC guidelines for the fall were published in detail a day after Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, spoke at a conference with Gov. Ned Lamont. Emanuel said he did not see how football, or any contact sports, could be played this fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glen Lungarini, the executive director of the CIAC, responded that the entire plan being released “remains fluid.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We understand that what we have today can change based on what the health metrics and the recommendations are tomorrow," Lungarini said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"But we recognize that our student-athletes really need sports, not just the educational component of this to truly come back to that school experience.”</p>
