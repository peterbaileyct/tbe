<p>NEWINGTON – In Bristol Eastern’s first round showdown against Newington in the Central Connecticut Conference’s championship bracket, junior sensation Ciara Collins scored her 1,000<sup>th</sup> point of her scholastic career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 2:52 left to play in the second stanza, Collins drained a straight on 3 for point number 12 against the Indians – becoming the ninth Eastern player in program history to score her 1,000<sup>th </sup>point.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, Eastern just couldn’t generate the victory against Newington as the locals fell by a 55-35 final from the Richard E. Rogalski Gymnasium in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home squad moved to 13-0 overall while the Lancers fell to 10-3 and will play at Middletown on Wednesday to wrap up the campaign.</p>

<p>Collins finished the contest with 15 points, seven rebounds, and two assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sage Scarritt added six points and four rebounds while Taigan Parent nabbed two points and four rebounds for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lilley Ferguson led all players with 19 points while Karissa Zocco had 13 to pace the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never had a chance in this one as Newington scored eight points over the first 56 seconds of the showdown and eventually rack up a 21-4 push with two minutes to play in the first quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers tried to make a game of it as Janessa Gonzalez (three points, two rebounds) put back a miss, Collins hit a 3 and when Scarritt drained a free throw, Eastern trailed 21-10 through one but was hanging around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cali Doyon (three assists) found Scarritt for a bucket early in the second stanza and when Collins put in her own offensive rebound, the game was a single-digit affair (23-14) with 6:30 remaining in the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ferguson followed up with a 3 and a jumper and with 5:02 left in the second stanza, Newington led 28-14 and was never in serious trouble again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins drained her historic 3, with 2:58 left in the second, that chopped the deficit to 30-18 but Newington extended its cushion to 33-19 at the half and the score ballooned from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, Collins and Scarritt hit hoops towards the end of the quarter but with eight minutes to play, the contest was a 47-25 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late in the fray, Audrey Tice scooped in a hoop and Vanessa Drury banked in a shot but in the end, Newington picked up a twenty-point win to advance in the championship bracket.</p>
