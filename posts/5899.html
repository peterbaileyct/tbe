<p>NEW BRITAIN - The Bristol Central boys track and field team finished in the top-25 as a unit from the 2021 CIAC Connecticut State Track and Field Open from Willow Brook Park in New Britain on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams scored 10 points as a team, placing 24th overall, while a couple athletes had tremendous showings to score team points for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Nate DeAngelo, UMASS Lowell bound in the fall, had his hands full in a loaded 1600 meters field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo had to battle Conard’s all-world talent Gavin Sherry and Nicholas Bendtsen from Wolcott in a star-studded event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior from Central made an amazing finish, seizing fourth in the field and once again put himself into the pages of the BCHS records book.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Senior Captain Nate DeAngelo was awesome once again, running 4:12.54 for 1600 meters, [made] a fourth-place finish and lowered his own school record” time said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “He also placed fifth in the 3200 with a time of 9:23.03.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sherry finished the 3200 in under 9:00 minutes and there wasn’t any one in the field that was going to catch the speedster though DeAngelo had excellent showings in both the one- and two-mile challenges.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s sophomore sensation Treshawn Blair placed eighth in the triple jump with a leap of 41 feet, 7.75 inches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior co-captain Jakob Salinas placed 11th in the javelin with a toss of 148 feet, eight inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just getting through the event proved to be one heck of an effort by Salinas as he dealt with a rather bizarre situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His javelin ended up malfunctioning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Jakob Salinas had a tough day in javelin,” said Stafford-Kirk. “His trusty javelin broke in half in the air during his first throw. Literally no one has ever seen that happen before. He had a tough time using a borrowed javelin after that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Victor Rosa placed 16th in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.26 seconds and while Frankie Porrini didn’t clear the opening height in the high jump, the sophomore “gained a lot of valuable experience,” during postseason competition said Stafford-Kirk.</p>

<p>Hillhouse, the Class L champions, won the Open behind 50 points while Hall of West Hartford - the squad that scooped up the Class LL title - came in second with 44.</p>
