<p>MADISON – After a promising start by the Bristol Central baseball team in CIAC Class L second round play, the top seeded squad in the bracket used a huge second inning scoring barrage to eventually topple the Rams on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 Daniel Hand upended Central by a 9-3 final as the No. 16 ranked Rams ended their season at 10-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Rams  jumped to a  2-0 lead in the top of the first frame, Hand attacked Central in the second stanza, collecting six runs to snare a 6-2 lead and did not look back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Lorenzetti absorbed the loss for the locals while Matt Beaucar and Frank Spirito also saw time on the hill for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Carone (4-0) earned the win for the Tigers who moved onto the quarterfinal round of the Class L tourney – squaring off against No. 9 Bethel (14-5) on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central managed to out-hit the Tigers 7-5 as Sean Wininger blasted out a solo home run while Adam Caron was 3-of-4 from the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hand’s Anthony DePino added a three-run homer and collected four RBI for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Tigers, Jack Pireaux smoked out a single and added two RBI while Danny Weinstein had a base hit for Hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Hand dropped in those six runs, Central added one in the top of the fifth to trim the deficit to 6-3 before the top seed put three additional runs on the scoreboard in the bottom of the tilt to put the game out of reach at 9-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hand is now 18-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was the final one for Central seniors Roberto Cruz, Chris Osuch, Adam Caron, Jacoby Banks, Michael Lorenzetti, Sean Wininger, Matt Beaucar, and Dylan Hudson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Central head coach Bunty Ray collected a milestone to open tournament play while just missing out on another against Hand. The 5-1 victory over Farmington on June 1 was Ray’s 300<sup>th</sup> game for the program. The win against the River Hawks was also Ray’s 199<sup>th</sup> victory at Bristol Central. The long time skipper will wait until next season to win his 200<sup>th</sup> game.</p>
