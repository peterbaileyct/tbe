<p>Dear Editors,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This used to be solely a newspaper letter to the editor...but with the decrease in newspaper circulation, it's become mostly a virtual letter to the Bristol community. Here's my annual list to help those in need.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My garden is looking good this year. Last year, the zucchinis didn't do so well but I had tomatoes galore but few of the agencies below could accept fresh produce due to Covid.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, there are more folks than ever who are in need. If you have a garden, please consider donating your excess produce. If you don't, please consider making a donation in other&nbsp;ways to&nbsp;help the agencies below. People in our community are in need all year and thus, we need to be generous, if we can, twelve months a year.</p>
