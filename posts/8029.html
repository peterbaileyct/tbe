<p>The Central Connecticut Conference has changed its football format once again — moving from three divisions, with East and West sections, to a straight-up four tier set-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a needed change that, obviously, did not take geography into consideration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in terms of past records and performances, all four tiers have been set up appropriately in terms of win/loss records.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, the playing field is extremely level and balanced with a little crossover along the way to boot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC has 31 football squads in 2021 with Tier 4 the only division that has seven teams instead of eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, and probably the next, Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern will make up positions in Tier 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s check out the CCC scholastic football breakdown this year with current records included from all the action during week one</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll also look at Week 1’s CCC scoreboard as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The Avon/Tolland game was postponed during Week 1. No official reason was given for the postponement according to the Collinsville Press. COVID-19 could have knocked out the game and a make-up should be scheduled for the bye week in October.</p>
