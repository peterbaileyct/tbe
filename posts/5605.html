<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern softball team honored its senior core on Wednesday afternoon as the trio of Jasmine Perez, Riley Giblin, and Jennifer Black played in their final regular season home game for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the victory was nearly a flawless one as the Lancers scooped up a 10-0 victory over Lewis Mills from the Bristol Eastern softball field on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the tenth victory of the season for Eastern (10-5) while the Spartans, a very good softball team, fell to 10-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the seniors led the charge in the CCC South tilt with Perez going 3-of-4 from the dish, dropping in another home run, while producing six RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giblin went 1-for-3 with an RBI and Black played a tough right field to lead the senior contingent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also tallying multiple hits in the game were Ali Tellier (2-for-4, three runs), Samantha Policki (2-for-4, two RBI), Janessa Gonzalez (2-for-4), and Grace D’Amato (2-for-3, two runs scored).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern went for 14 hits while on the flip side, the game belonged to Tellier in the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chucker moved to 10-4 on the season, allowed minimal hits, walking only one and retiring 13 straight midway through the game to keep the Spartans guessing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Great defense all day behind Ali who limited Mills to just three hits and struck out nine,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hailey Gorack doubled for the Spartans and drew a tough loss on the mound for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policki nabbed an RBI single in the first frame while Perez did the same in the second to give the home team a 2-0 edge through two completed innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quiet third tilt, Eastern went for four runs in both the fourth and fifth stanzas to knock Lewis Mills out of contention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth, D’Amato scored on a wild pitch and after Tellier singled and Giblin walked, Perez smashed a three-run homer to give the Kingstreeters a 6-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the fifth, Giblin and Policki added RBI singles while Perez’s base hit brought home two runners and quickly, it was a 10-0 game through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills dropped in back-to-back one out singles in the sixth but Tellier retired the final five batters she faced as Eastern grabbed a 10-0 win to end the home portion of its regular season slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It was] Senior day. Shout out to Bristol Eastern seniors Jasmine Perez, Riley Giblin, and Jennifer Black for all they have sacrificed the last four years,” said Redman.</p>
