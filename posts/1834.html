<p>TBE is seeking volunteers to submit short reports, reviews and photos. TBE does not pay for submissions but guarantees professional editing and guidance as well as a regular byline for writers and photographers who work within and meet our journalistic requirements, policies and ethical framework.</p>

<p>Examples of stories would be those tracking what is happening in neighborhoods, from writing about flowering trees and plants and animal sightings to notable incidents and other items of broader interest that represent life in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ideally, TBE would like volunteer correspondents from neighborhoods in each section of the city: north, northeast, northwest, central, south, southeast, southwest. If you have thought about writing, this might be the time to follow through and aim for publication.</p>

<p>In addition, TBE is seeking volunteers to write reviews of books, TV programs, music and movies. Ideally, book, movie and tv reviewers would have an interest in a particular genre, from non-fiction or fiction, from mystery to suspense to horror to romance to contemporary among others.</p>

<p>The same would hold true for music reviewers.</p>

<p>Finally, TBE is looking for volunteers to cover the following beats: city council, public works, water department, police and fire departments, board of education, small business, large business, sports and history. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beat volunteers would have to adhere to specific requirements of our journalistic ethos, focusing on reporting and not editorializing.</p>
