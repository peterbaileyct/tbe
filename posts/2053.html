<p>The vote had been postponed a week to pursue further cuts, which have resulted in a reduction from the original increase of 38.5 mills to 38.38 mills.</p>

<p>For an idea about what this means, a property assessed at $150,000 will incur an increase of $49.5 for the tax year 2020-21 or $4.125 a month.</p>

<p>In a social media post, Bristol Republican Town Chair Jeff Caggiano, writing on behalf of the Republican Town Committee, issued a statewide invitation for individuals to join in a protest rally against the increase. The rally is scheduled at 5 p.m. in the parking area across from city hall.</p>
