<p>The Bristol Central softball team has a bunch of veteran performers and once the unit gets a little time to gel, the Rams are going to be a tough squad to top in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The seniors rule at Central and expect some very good results from several experienced players - mixed in with a little youth on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s talent at several positions for the Rams and here’s what to expect over at Central this year:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL SOFTBALL</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Monica Hayes (6th season. In five seasons, Hayes is 55-50 overall)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2019 season</strong>: 11-10 overall. Ranked No. 15 in the Class L tournament fray in 2019, the Rams lost in first round play to No. 18 Foran, 5-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Losses</strong>: Peyton Greger (Pitcher), Kaylee Hall, Maria Santilli.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Returning Players</strong>: Gwen Torreso (sr, SS), Kayla St. Onge (sr, 1b), Brooke Soucy (sr, 3b), Emily Ericson (sr, OF), Gabby Buonafede (jr, 3b), Ryleigh Hall (jr, OF), Sarah Romano (jr, C,OF), Kayleigh Dionne (sr, 2b), Janessa Bartell (sr, OF/3B), Kaley Laird (so, 2B), Sam Sklenka ( (so, OF), Leah Sklenka (fr, OF), Arianna Rivera (fr, OF), Sophia Torreso (so, P/1B), Alex Sciarretto (so. P/3B).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2021 Season Outlook</strong>: The Rams are ready for the 2021 campaign to commence because the squad is going to be a good one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hayes has an excellent balance of veteran talent and youth and expects big things from the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s that senior core, led by standout Gwen Torreso, who will be the difference makers on this squad,&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The seniors are going to lead a group of young, talented players,” said Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gwen Torreso is a supremely talented performer and the shortstop is a dual threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The All-Conference selection in 2019 batted .493 as a sophomore and can blast the ball all over the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She plays more than a little defense, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then add in the versatile senior Vanessa Bartell, another athlete who can play third base or roam the outfield for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are going to lean on Gwen’s experience at shortstop and at the plate, as well as Janessa’s versatility,” said Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there are other veterans around the horn with senior Kayla St. Onge at first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Brooke Soucy is over at third base while fellow senior Emily Ericson man’s one of the positions in the outfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, in the outfield for the Rams will be juniors Ryleigh Hall and Sarah Romano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Romano will also help catch for the program’s young pitching staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Continuing around the infield, junior Gabby Buonafede (third base) and senior Kayleigh Dionne (second base) will be vital components of Central’s defensive schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s a couple of sophomores and freshmen who will be looking to leave their marks this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomores Kaley Laird (second base) and Sam Sklenka (outfield) hope to get some playing time along with freshmen outfielders Leah Sklenka and Arianna Rivera.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have a mix of young talent and veteran players that will compete for playing time, something we haven’t had in many years,” said Hayes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the mound will be a couple of second-year standouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto replace out-going Peyton Greger who was a tremendous chucker for the program over the last couple seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sophomores Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto will split time in the circle, while also playing first base and third base respectively,” said Hayes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Central squad is going to be tough to top as the year unfolds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch…</strong>Central begins its season at home on Wednesday, squaring off against Simsbury from the BC softball field. On Friday, April 23, the Rams tangles with state power Southington on the road. And then on May 5 and May 24, it’s another chapter of the Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern rivalry with the annual city series softball showdowns.&nbsp;</p>
