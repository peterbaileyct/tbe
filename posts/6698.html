<h2>Major upset at West Woods in Farmington</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>A quartet of retired Bristol Eastern teachers from an earlier century played a grudge match at West Woods on Friday morning, and it turned out to be a nail-biter.  The duo of Rick Lindquist and Bob Rottler edged Bob Zysk and Jack Krampitz  on the 18th hole with a par by Lindquist doing the damage. Said loser Zysk, “Lindquist hasn’t had a par in 14 years. It was quite a shock.”</h5>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Lindquist was unavailable for comment. <br></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Tension was high, Rottler, always a shady character, changed his score on the 14th hole to put his team within reach. Krampitz, a former English teacher, could be heard muttering, “We trust Bob, for surely he is an honorable man.” Krampitz was treated later that day for a stab wound in the back.</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>As of press time tonight, there is no word on Krampitz’s condition.</h5>
