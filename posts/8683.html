<p>"We played hard and smart throughout most of the contest," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "We didn't capitalize on our chances, especially after controlling play in the first half.&nbsp; Across the board, the team played well while Dylan Piazza, Connor Cyr, and Ty Borry had especially solid efforts as did Carlos Portillo, in goal, who saved a penalty kick."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Portillo collected eight saves while Middletown's Tyler Hahn had six for the winners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
