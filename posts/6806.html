<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol American Legion Baseball squad, off another incredible all-around effort from Class L All-State talent Andrew Lozier, won its rubber match against West Hartford on Wednesday night, flipping the squad by a 3-1 final at Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier truly dominated for Bristol (16-6 overall, 14-5 Zone 1) as he threw 103 pitches over a stellar complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just one run on six hits, walked two while striking out 10 to move Lozier to a perfect 4-0 this year.</p>

<p>“If we’re going to do something, we need [Lozier] to be the best he can be and today he was the best he can be,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “He pitched awesome. He had a big hit.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford (11-6 overall, 10-6 Zone 1) was the home squad as&nbsp;the showdown was a make-up game. Bristol won the season series, 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s defense was sharp behind Lozier with Evan Bouchard (shortstop), Jack Kozikowski (third base), Matt Beaucar (second) and Adam Caron (first) making several big plays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was huge,” said Lozier of the effort from the defense. “Everyone played their part. We had Jack who hasn’t played at third base since his sophomore year in high school. Matt doesn’t get in the field a lot but they both played well. Jack had some crazy plays. He kept us in and kept us going for sure.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just like the Avon game the previous Monday, Lozier went on the attack with two outs in the top of the first frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier zipped in a long double into centerfield but never advanced while the slugger took the hill, generating two quick outs before Tucker Redden slipped a one-hopper into right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But off one final pop-out by Joe Dooley, the game was scoreless through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the second stanza, Bristol’s Owen Davis blasted a two-base hit and Jack Kozikowski followed with a single to right field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The throw in from right skittered away from third base as Davis easily scored to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kozikowski later stole third but never advanced after as West Hartford’s Ixael Albina made a spectacular catch at second base on a Trevor Nohilly line-drive that was headed to the gap in right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And through an inning-and-a-half of work, Post 2 was in front 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier made quick work of Post 96 in the second, generating two Ks along the way, as Bristol entered the third tilt still ahead by a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two outs in the inning, Bristol went on the attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier walked to put one on and then Fradette slammed a long fly ball to center that was just out of reach of the fielder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol pitcher scored on the double, making it 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford started the third with zest as Albina slipped a ball into right to leadoff the bottom of the third inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Ciafone drew a base-on-balls with one out as Post 96 had men on first and second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier fanned Dave Cantarella but Redden dropped a ball by third base, scoring Albina, as West Hartford chopped the deficit in half - 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dooley then struck out as Lozier ended up punching out the side with Bristol due up in the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the fourth, Kozikowski flipped in his second single of the evening and Beaucar walked to put two on with one out on the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a 5-3 inning-ending double-play saw West Hartford sneak out of the jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pete Langevin posted a two-out infield hit to third base but when Albina struck out, Lozier had seven Ks through four innings of work and a 2-1 edge in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Brown (2-for-4) opened the fifth with an infield hit to the first baseman who was jammed on the play and never had a chance to get the speedy runner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown stole second and then made it to third safely off a bad pickoff throw by West Hartford pitcher Eli Salomons (5 IP, six hits, 5 Ks).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette struck out to end the stanza but Lozier sent down West Hartford in order - retiring seven of his last eight batters - to keep Bristol ahead, 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kozikowski got on a base safely a third time with one away in the sixth as a throwing miscue to first base saw the runner easily take second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Redden, taking the mound for Post 96 to start the inning, struck out the side to keep it a one-run contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier, at just 64 pitches, continued to throw strikes into the bottom of the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tommy LaSpada walked with two gone and Nick Udell came into pinch run, stealing second to get into scoring position - representing the tying run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Mike Weiss struck out for the third time on the evening as Lozier nabbed his eighth K and going into the final inning, it was still a 2-1 game in Bristol’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nohilly opened the top of the seventh with a flare to right, good for a base hit, and with Brown up, it was small-ball time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown dropped a beautiful bunt to the third base side of the mound as the tally went for a hit and everyone was safe for Post 2.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then another bunt, this time by Caron, saw Nohilly running for third base and that’s where the ball was supposed to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was booted by the bag, Nohilly scored and an insurance run, leading to a 3-1 push for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier then drew his second walk of the game - putting runners on first and second - all with just one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol did not score again in the seventh as West Hartford had to net two runs to force extra innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier fanned Langevin, Albina flew out to right, but Seth Ehrlich singled to left to keep the game going for the ‘home’ team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ciafone then bounced a ball up the middle that was nipped by the glove of Lozier, landing a few feet in front of shortstop for an infield hit - putting two on with two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the tying runner at first base, Cantarella - battling to the end - drew a full count over an at-bat that saw 10-plus pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Right there in the end, he was at his pitch limit,” said LaPenta of Lozier. “He could finish the batter but if he comes out, I’ve got [Dylan Woodsome] coming in…but [Lozier] really showed me something there. [Cantarella] had a nice at-bat. He fouled off a lot of pitches, there were a couple of tough curveballs, and he really battled there.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the eleventh pitch of the at-bat, Lozier struck out Cantarella as Bristol won, 3-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a real enjoyable game to coach,” said LaPenta. “We executed well. We bunted. [West Hartford] played into some nice plays [and] we made some nice plays.”&nbsp;</p>
