<p>“The team was really on fire,” said Bentley.&nbsp;“We, the coaches, asked them to impress us, to show us what they had learned and they did.&nbsp;It was a short season, but I am hopeful that they walked away knowing, even though there are things outside of [their] control, what you bring to the table, what you show up with, is your choice and therefore always, in your control.”</p>
