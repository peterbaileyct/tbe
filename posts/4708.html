<p>Come Sunday morning, I will have been vaccinated, and Mary, too. We are both in the 55-65 age group: I am a teacher. She put her name on a waiting list and got a call mid-week: “Can you come in today!” Done. As a teacher, I qualified for one at a clinic set up through the school system and Hartford Health. Mary received a Moderna injection, which requires a second shot. I received Johnson and Johnson, one and done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(And while I am very grateful to be among those qualifying for a vaccination early—teachers—I do not understand how frontline workers weren’t granted the same option.)&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At school there was plenty of discussion about whether we should avoid Johnson and Johnson, because of the efficacy rate. News articles flew back and forth among us. We consulted with each other. I consulted with the science people. The consensus was, go for it. Follow the advice to get vaccinated, because that is a priority. And then there was this: the efficacy rate of Johnson and Johnson was established against a different background than Pfizer and Moderna. Comparing these with Johnson and Johnson is like comparing apples and oranges.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, Johnson and Johnson was tested against South American and South African variants. The others were not. In addition, Pfizer and Moderna use a new technology, while Johnson and Johnson used a more traditional one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, they are all good, whether one shot or two, whether old or new technology, whether tested against new variants. The whole process—made possible by our money, money from our taxes, poured into the creation of these vaccinations—is nothing short of miraculous, a game changer in a world that promises variants and other viruses for us to have to deal with in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, getting vaccinated is a game changer when it comes to protecting us from infections and mortality, but it does not change social distancing and mask wearing for the most part, simply because people who have not been vaccinated are susceptible to the virus—get this, vaccinated people can carry the disease. The Centers for Disease Control are still working out the science, answering the questions, who can meet in small groups without masks, with masks; when&nbsp;unvaccinated children can&nbsp;kiss their grandparents; is meeting outside still the best venue for family gatherings; and on and on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s are two podcasts to listen to for more information from people who are experts, both on the vaccinations and another on how we will know when the pandemic will have ended:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/avoiding-temptation-vaccine-shop-on-the-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On The Media’s “Avoiding the Temptation to Shop the Vaccines”</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/what-does-pandemic-ending-look-on-the-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“What Does a Pandemic Ending Look LIke?”</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s lots of information out there, too much. And making an appointment online, is still anxiety invoking. I am not saying it’s impossible; all I am saying is that you need to steel yourself and persist. Of course, there are alternatives to online registration: phone lines, and they require patience—because everyone is trying to get vaccinated, which is the point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I headed to Wethersfield for my shot, where I had an appointment. All told, I was in an out in half an hour; however, a colleague who had a later appointment had a much longer wait when a bunch of teachers showed up having been informed that there would be extra vaccines.&nbsp;</p>
