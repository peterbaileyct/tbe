<p>On Sunday, Aug. 23, John Holt of the CAS CIAC released a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://ciacsports.com/site/?author=8" target="_blank">statement</a> summarizing the decision of the Board of Control and its vote earlier in the day to allow conditioning activities for all fall sports, beginning Monday. </p>

<p>In the statement, Holt discloses that fall sports such as football and volleyball, which the Department of Public Health had earlier recommended be moved to the spring, will not be rescheduled if cancelled this fall.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Probably the most ominous phrase in their release is the phrase, "the plan will remain fluid," indicating either a sense of irony or the hope that the entire season will not "flow away."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The statement begins with the announcement that the decision came in alignment with and after "positive discussions with the Connecticut Department of Public Health."</p>

<p>Holt writes that "conducting conditioning and sport specific skill work as non-contact and in small cohorts is classified as low risk regardless of the sport."</p>
