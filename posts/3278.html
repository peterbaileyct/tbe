<p>FARMINGTON - What was the best way for the Bristol Central boys cross county team to wrap up the regular season?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about establish a new course record on the road?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, that’s exactly what Central senior Nate DeAngelo accomplished on Wednesday afternoon during a Central Connecticut Conference, Region B contest in Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The speedster from Central finished the race against the Indians in 16:15 - seizing first place and rewriting the course record in the process from Winding Trails.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More importantly, the Rams picked up the team win, defeating Farmington 23-38 as Central had four of its top runners place in the top six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeAngelo, having a sensational season on the courses, finished 46 seconds in front of the runner up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that second place finisher, Central’s Frankie Porrini, ran extremely well with a time of 17:01.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 1-2 punch of DeAngelo and Porriri has been a strong combination all season, and led Central to the eventual victory on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indians Brendan Kelly (17:14) and Charlie Driscoll (17:59) placed third and fourth, respectively, but Central’s Chris Roy and Ray Peters were the next two athletes to cross the finish line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy (5th, 18:47) and Peters (6th, 19:03) made strong showings, followed by the Indians’ Thatcher Gorman (7th, 19:03) and Alen Joseph (8th, 19:04), before two additional Central runners rounded out the top-10 and made the event academic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reggie Gonzales finished in ninth at 19:16 and Austin Freve placed 10th with a time of 19:52.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the regular season behind the Rams, the program has one final date on their slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central travels to Stanley Quarter Park next Tuesday for the Central Connecticut Conference, Region B Postseason challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meet starts at 3 p.m. in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will take another shot at Avon, who defeated the Bristol squad 24-37 to open the campaign on October 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central will also take aim at Southington, a meet that resulted in a narrow 25-36 loss back on October 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a strong finish to the 2020 season, Central should be feeling confident going into the meet with its experienced group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Rams ended the regular season at 5-2.</p>
